# Repository Provenance

## Purpose

Read this before deciding whether this skill is current for a checkout of the PettingZoo repository. If the current repo commit, dirty state, package version, or major evidence paths differ from this snapshot, run `refresh-repo-skill`.

## Snapshot

The source evidence snapshot was captured before writing the generated `skills/` output. Generated DisCo files under `skills/` are not source evidence for PettingZoo behavior.

## Refresh Check

- If `git rev-parse HEAD` differs from `repository.commit`, treat the skill as potentially stale and run `refresh-repo-skill`.
- If package metadata, public environment modules, test helper signatures, optional dependency groups, or docs/tutorial workflows changed, run `refresh-repo-skill`.
- If a checkout is dirty only because it contains this generated `skills/` directory, compare source paths outside generated DisCo output before deciding that PettingZoo behavior changed.
- If PettingZoo adds, removes, or renames environment families, extras, wrappers, or compliance helpers, refresh the skill even on the same commit.
