# Cate CLI

`cate` is available inside Cate terminals and agent shells. It talks to the
current workspace and requires the relevant Settings → CLI permission.

Start by listing panels:

```bash
cate panel list
```

When working repeatedly with one panel, select it for the current agent or
terminal session:

```bash
cate panel set 1a2b3c4d
cate panel current
```

The selection is isolated by a per-terminal CLI session, so other agents and
terminals keep their own targets. Short ids from `panel list`
are accepted. Use `--panel <id>` only as a one-command override. Clear the
selection to return to Cate's automatic focused/grouped resolution:

```bash
cate panel clear
```

Selections can point to any native panel. Browser and terminal commands reject
a selected panel of the wrong type instead of silently controlling another
panel. If a selected panel was closed, select another panel before continuing.

## Browser workflow

Browser control uses persistent JavaScript with the `cua` tab API. The old argv
actions, selectors, page evaluation, and revisioned string refs have been removed.
Start by binding a tab to get its accessibility state, then request a screenshot
when visual context is useful:

```bash
cate browser run 'var tab = await cua.getTab({panelId:"<full-panel-id>"});'
cate browser run 'await tab.getAXStateAndScreenshot();'
```

Use full panel IDs inside JavaScript. `--panel <id>` supports short IDs as an
override for CLI panel resolution. Discover tabs with `await cua.listTabs()`.
Create a tab with `await cua.createBrowserTab("https://example.com")`, or pass
`{panelId:tab.panelId}` as the second argument to choose its panel. Pass
`{newPanel:true}` to create a separate panel; Cate also creates one when needed.
Bindings pin both panel and tab; they never silently follow a user's tab switch.

Use numeric IDs from the latest AX observation. For example, after observing a form
containing textbox 17 and button 42:

```bash
cate browser run 'await tab.setValue(17,"user@example.com"); await tab.click(42); await tab.waitFor({url:"**/dashboard"});'
cate browser run 'await tab.getAXStateAndScreenshot();'
```

Do not guess IDs or coordinates. Observations contain `kind`, `observationId`,
`documentId`, URL, title and viewport. AX observations (`kind:"ax"`) also contain
accessibility state and structured elements with role, name, value and states.
`getAXState()` normally emits a concise diff; `getAXState({disableDiffing:true})`
emits the full tree. `getScreenshot()` returns only viewport pixels/identity
(`kind:"image"`, empty state/elements), avoiding an AX scan. It does not refresh
numeric IDs. `getAXStateAndScreenshot()` refreshes both together. The SDK keeps
the last AX observation for numeric targets and the latest visual observation
for coordinates. `{emit:false}` suppresses automatic output. `{profile:true}`
adds phase timings, image bytes and estimated retained-cache usage. Each code
cell retains at most 16 million serialized observation characters, including
`emit:false`; split long screenshot loops across cells.

The SDK carries the latest observation through each action and emits fresh state.
Numeric IDs persist within one document; navigation requires fresh IDs. Coordinate
actions use `[x,y]` in observed viewport CSS pixels and reject stale viewport
coordinates. A dispatched click is not proof that a business operation completed:
use `waitFor` or inspect the resulting state.

```javascript
await tab.click(42);                         // or [x,y]
await tab.setValue(17, "replacement");
await tab.typeText("insert at selection");
await tab.pressKey("Return");
await tab.selectText(17, "text", {selectionType:"cursor_after"});
await tab.scroll([400,300], "down", 1);
await tab.drag([100,100], [300,200]);
await tab.setChecked(42, true);
await tab.selectOption(42, ["DE"]);
await tab.upload(42, "/authorized/file");
await tab.waitFor({text:"Saved"});
await tab.waitFor({element:42, state:"enabled"});
await tab.goto("https://example.com");
await tab.back(); await tab.forward(); await tab.reload();
await tab.setViewport({width:1280,height:800});
await tab.resize({width:800,height:600});
await tab.downloads(); await tab.close();
```

Keep deterministic batches short and inspect unexpected changes before continuing.
Use `var` for reusable bindings; top-level `await` is supported. The session has
no Node.js, filesystem, network, or DOM evaluation access. Await every action.
`nodeRepl.write(value)` adds text output. `cate browser reset` clears JavaScript
bindings without closing tabs. Reset and timeout cancel queued and pending browser
actions; input already dispatched cannot be undone. Sessions are isolated per
terminal/agent through `CATE_CLI_SESSION_ID`; timed-out sessions reset.
`typeText` resolves current focus before inserting at the current selection,
including fields inside frames and shadow roots.

`cate browser run 'await tab.getAXStateAndScreenshot();'` returns AX state and
saves a screenshot to a temporary PNG file. Open the printed path with your image-viewing tool before visual
reasoning. Shell output cannot itself attach pixels to the model. `--json`
returns structured content with base64 image data; base64 text is not visual
input. The same screenshot output works from `tab.getScreenshot()` in code.
AX reads remain available in code for deterministic branches and extraction.

Agent actions display a cursor and click ripples in the browser panel, without
field bounding-box highlights. Filling and typing animate the cursor at the
edited field. User input takes control back and cancels pending automation. Responsive viewport size and canvas
panel size are independent; `resize` applies only to canvas panels with a 400×300
minimum.

## Other surfaces

```bash
cate editor open src/app.tsx:42
cate panel create terminal
cate panel create canvas
cate panel set <id>
cate panel current
cate panel clear
cate panel close <id>
```

Read a terminal before sending input. `type` does not append Enter:

```bash
cate panel set 1a2b3c4d
cate terminal read
cate terminal type npm test
cate terminal press enter
```

Terminal input goes to whatever currently owns that PTY, including foreground
TUIs. Never send keys until the panel id and current screen are verified.

## Agent orchestration

Use `cate agent` when a task benefits from visible, persistent delegation:
independent parallel work, cross-provider review, or isolated implementation in
a Cate worktree. Keep small, tightly coupled edits in the current agent.

Discover registered runs before acting on an older mission or after context
compaction:

```bash
cate agent list
```

Create a worker with a bounded, self-contained prompt and concrete success
criteria. Cate chooses the first hook-ready registered agent when `--agent` is
omitted:

```bash
cate agent create "Inspect the API boundary and report risks" --title "API scout"
cate agent create "Implement the parser and run its focused tests" \
  --agent codex --title "Parser" --new-worktree agent/parser
cate agent create "Review the current worktree changes" --worktree <worktree-id>
cate agent create "Continue in this terminal" --terminal <terminal-panel-id>
```

`--terminal` reuses an idle terminal panel by restarting its PTY with the
selected agent. It rejects busy terminals, agent-owned terminals, and the
calling terminal. Omit it to create a new terminal panel.

Workers may recursively create and supervise their own workers with the same
commands. This naturally forms an agent tree: each terminal owns the workers it
creates, and each parent normally communicates with its direct children. Use
recursion when another level of decomposition is genuinely useful, not merely
to relay a simple instruction.

Supervise workers through the agent lifecycle rather than typing into their
terminals:

```bash
cate agent wait <run-id> [<run-id>...] --wait-timeout 10000
cate agent inspect <run-id>
cate agent send <run-id> "Please add the missing regression test"
cate agent review <run-id>
cate agent apply <run-id>
cate agent keep <run-id>
cate agent discard <run-id>
cate agent stop <run-id>
```

Run ids may be the unique short ids printed by `cate agent list`. `wait` accepts
5000–60000 milliseconds and may be called with no ids to monitor all live
direct children. Call it again while workers remain active. `inspect` includes
recent terminal output; use `cate terminal read --panel <panel-id>` only as a
lower-level diagnostic fallback.

Prefer `send` for follow-up work on the same responsibility. If
`followUpSupported` is false, create a fresh worker instead. When a worker fails,
inspect `failureReason`; a provider-specific authentication, quota, or service
failure can justify retrying with a different registered `--agent`.

For an isolated worker, ask it to run relevant checks and commit completed work,
then use `review` before choosing `apply`, `keep`, or `discard`. Apply rechecks
that the worktree is clean and mergeable. Discard permanently removes a
worker-owned worktree and its branch, including uncommitted changes, without an
interactive confirmation. Keep records that the worktree should remain for
later. Review is read-only: a finished process or successful review does not
mean its branch has been integrated. The parent remains responsible for
verification and for reporting any uncommitted or unintegrated work.

## Review panels

Select a Review Panel once, inspect its comparison, and record structured
findings. `--panel <id>` is an optional one-command override for every review
command.

```bash
cate panel set <review-panel-id>
cate review inspect
cate review note add --file src/app.ts --line 42 --side new \
  --severity error --body "Handle the rejected request"
cate review note resolve <note-id>
cate review complete
```

Use `complete` only when running as the review agent assigned by that Review
Panel. Review commands record findings; they do not modify files, stage,
commit, or push changes.
