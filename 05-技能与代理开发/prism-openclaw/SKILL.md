# Prism Liquidity Agent (OpenClaw)

Prism is an autonomous liquidity agent for Solana Meteora DLMM pools. This skill
lets OpenClaw query Prism, receive alerts, and remind the user to check positions.

## When to use

- User asks about liquidity pool management on Solana.
- User wants to start, stop, configure, or monitor the Prism trading agent.
- User says "check my Prism positions", "any alerts from Prism?", or "should I rebalance?"
- Prism sent an alert via the OpenClaw Gateway and the user replies for context.

## Quick start

```bash
# Configure (non-interactive)
prism setup --non-interactive --helius-key=$HELIUS_API_KEY

# Start with OpenClaw overlay enabled
export AGENTIC_MODE=true
export AGENT_RUNTIME=openclaw
export AGENT_GATEWAY_URL=ws://127.0.0.1:18789
prism dev
```

## Regular checks

OpenClaw should remind the user every hour while Prism is running:

```bash
# Run from this skill's scripts folder
{baseDir}/scripts/prism-checkin.sh
```

This fetches a short markdown summary suitable for Telegram/Discord/Slack/WhatsApp.

## On-demand queries

| Query | Command |
|-------|---------|
| Full JSON status | `prism status --json` |
| Messaging summary | `{baseDir}/scripts/prism-checkin.sh` |
| Open positions | `curl -s http://127.0.0.1:18790/positions` |
| Recent decisions | `curl -s http://127.0.0.1:18790/decisions` |

## Decision flow

For each pool on each scan cycle:

1. Fetch pool state and bin array from Meteora via Helius RPC.
2. Compute metrics: fee/IL ratio, volume authenticity, bin utilization, TVL velocity.
3. Apply decision rules: EXIT → REBALANCE → HOLD → ENTER.
4. Run risk gates: confidence, max positions, allocation cap.
5. Execute in paper or live mode.

## Alert priorities

When Prism sends an alert through the Gateway, surface it according to priority:

- `critical` — immediate notification (TVL collapse, trailing stop, stop-loss).
- `warning` — batched or quiet notification (volume auth drop, fee/IL drop, large unrealized loss).
- `info` — included in the next hourly summary (ENTER, REBALANCE).
