  DO NOT READ THIS FILE — This README.md is for human catalog browsing only.
  It ships inside the .skill package but is NEVER auto-loaded into agent context.

# Skill Creator

> Create, evaluate, benchmark, and iteratively improve agent skills.

## Highlights

- Iterative skill loop: draft, test prompts, evaluate, refine
- Subagent architecture guidance: design skills that delegate heavy work to subagents, keeping the main agent lean
- Quantitative + qualitative eval workflow with baseline comparison
- Benchmark aggregation, variance analysis, and report tooling
- Description optimization flow to improve triggering accuracy
- Dedicated eval viewer and grading agents for structured review
- Dependency preflight: a skill that invokes other skills ships a gate naming each dependency, how to install it, and how to verify it
- Run stats on every create/update run: elapsed time, agents, skills, tool calls, plus tokens and cost where the host reports them

## When to Use

| Say this...                        | Skill will...                                                        |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Create a skill for X"             | Interview you, draft SKILL.md + README.md, run test cases            |
| "Improve this skill"               | Run evals, collect feedback, suggest subagent restructuring, iterate |
| "Run evals for my skill"           | Execute test prompts, grade results, show benchmark                  |
| "Optimize skill triggering"        | Generate trigger eval queries, run optimization loop                 |
| "This skill is too slow / bloated" | Analyze for subagent refactoring opportunities                       |

## Output

Produces complete skill packages (SKILL.md + docs/README.md + agents/), eval results with benchmark reports, subagent restructuring recommendations, and optimized skill descriptions for accurate triggering.
