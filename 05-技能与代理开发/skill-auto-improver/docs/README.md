# Skill Auto-Improver

> Two-gate improvement loop for SKILL.md-based skills. Iterates until the target skill clears the **skill-creator standard** (mechanical validator + frontmatter audit + ≤500-line body + AI-skip README) **AND** the **asm-eval 85/8 floor** (overallScore > 85, every category ≥ 8) — or stops with a blocker report.

## Highlights

- **Two modes.** Mode 1 (default) retrofits a skill to the standard. Mode 2 — opt-in and user-confirmed — converts an existing skill onto per-step context delegation, so each heavy step hands its `references/` slice to a worker instead of the main agent holding the whole tree.
- **Two gates, both must pass.** Gate 1 = skill-creator standard (publish-blocking). Gate 2 = asm-eval 85/8 quality floor.
- Deterministic fixes first (`asm eval --fix`), then frontmatter normalization to satisfy `quick_validate.py`, then content fixes by lowest category.
- One category at a time, re-eval against **both** gates after every edit.
- Hard loop cap (8 iterations) so it never runs unbounded.
- Bumps the target skill's `metadata.version` once per iteration per skill-creator's Version Management rule.
- Saves every iteration JSON and gate-summary line to `.asm-improver/` for auditability.
- Reports a skill that invokes another skill without dependency metadata and a caller-owned first-use acquire/release lifecycle — and retrofits both.
- Writes a final before/after report on pass or blocker.
- Closes every run with a run-stats block: elapsed time, agents, skills, tool calls, plus tokens and cost where the host reports them.

## When to Use

| Say this...                             | Skill will...                                            |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Improve skills/my-skill"               | Baseline both gates, fix, loop, report                   |
| "Bring this skill up to standard"       | Same — Gate 1 retrofit takes priority over Gate 2 polish |
| "Level up this skill before publish"    | Same, with `asm publish` readiness as the goal           |
| "My skill scored 62 — fix it"           | Baseline, fix, loop until both gates clear or blocker    |
| "Run asm eval on skills/my-skill"       | **Not this skill** — just run `asm eval` directly        |
| "Author a brand-new skill from scratch" | **Not this skill** — use `/skill-creator` instead        |

## Usage

```
/skill-auto-improver skills/my-skill
```

Or paste a skill path and the skill triggers automatically. GitHub shorthand inputs are accepted but v1 asks you to clone locally first — remote editing is out of scope.

## How It Works

```mermaid
graph TD
    A["Phase 0: baseline both gates<br/>asm eval --json + quick_validate.py"] --> B{"Already passes<br/>both gates?"}
    B -- yes --> R["Write PASS report, exit"]
    B -- no --> C["Phase 1: asm eval --fix<br/>+ frontmatter normalize"]
    C --> D["Phase 2: clear Gate 1<br/>(skill-creator standard)"]
    D --> E["Phase 3: lowest asm-eval category"]
    E --> F["Apply fix from playbook"]
    F --> G["Phase 5: bump metadata.version"]
    G --> H["Re-run both gates"]
    H --> I{"Both cleared<br/>or cap hit?"}
    I -- no --> E
    I -- yes --> J["Phase 7: write report"]

    style J fill:#2196F3,color:#fff
```

## The Two Gates

### Gate 1 — skill-creator standard (must-pass)

- `quick_validate.py` exits 0 with no warnings
- Frontmatter audit clean (allowed top-level keys only, `metadata.version` + `metadata.author` present, YAML safety, name matches directory)
- Description ≤250 chars (target) with a negative-trigger clause
- SKILL.md body under 500 lines
- `docs/README.md` (if present) carries the AI-skip notice
- Bundled scripts print descriptive errors before exiting

### Gate 2 — asm-eval 85/8 quality floor

```
overallScore > 85   AND   min(categories[*].score) >= 8
```

Stricter than overall score alone — a skill at 86 with a 5 in `testability` still fails. Forces balanced quality across all 7 categories instead of letting one strong area hide a weak one.

## Stop Conditions

The loop stops on any of:

| 3 iterations with no movement on either gate          | BLOCKER          |
| 2 iterations with regression on either gate           | BLOCKER (revert) |
