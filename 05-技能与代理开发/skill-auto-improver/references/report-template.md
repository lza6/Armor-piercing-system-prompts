# Report template

The final `.asm-improver/report.md` produced by this skill. PASS layout first, BLOCKER layout second.

The report keeps **three sections visually distinct** so a reader never confuses one for another:

1. **Gate status** — the two hard gates (Gate 1 = skill-creator standard, Gate 2 = asm-eval 85/8). These decide PASS vs BLOCKER.
2. **Predictability findings** — the advisory Phase 2b audit. Listed in rubric order (items 1–7), never pass/fail; an open finding here is _not_ a gate failure.
3. **Unresolved blockers** — present only on BLOCKER, and only ever a failed **hard gate**.

## PASS example

```
# Skill improvement report

Skill: skills/my-skill

Gate 1 (skill-creator standard): √ pass
Gate 2 (asm-eval): overallScore 91, min category 8
Predictability audit: 5/7 pass, 2 advisory (non-blocking)
Iterations: 3 of 8
Target version: 0.2.0 → 1.0.0

## Predictability findings (advisory — not gates)

Source: Phase 2b audit against skill-creator's predictability rubric. None of these block PASS.

| # | Rubric item                          | Status   | Note |
|---|--------------------------------------|----------|------|
| 1 | Invocation chosen intentionally      | pass     | model-invoked; description triggers reliably |
| 2 | Branches mapped before the body      | pass     | create/improve selector at top |
| 3 | Demanding, checkable completion bars | advisory | step 4 ends on "looks complete" — tie to a count; left as-is to avoid scope creep |
| 4 | Progressive disclosure + delegability | pass     | long tables already in references/; no step heavy enough to hand a slice to a worker (a delegability finding would read: "step 3 is not delegable because it asks the user mid-step") |
| 5 | Leading words                        | pass     | — |
| 6 | No duplication / sprawl / no-ops     | advisory | "be thorough" line in step 2 is a no-op; candidate for a later pass |
| 7 | Publish-ready                        | pass     | would clear the rubric if re-created |

(If Phase 2b was skipped fail-soft because the rubric was unavailable, this section reads: `Predictability audit skipped — rubric not found at $RUBRIC (hard gates unaffected).`)

  ┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄
  Run stats   elapsed 4m 12s · tokens 128,400 · cost $0.42
              agents 0 · skills 1 · tool calls 63
```

The `Dependency preflight` row always appears; its label is **conditional**. A target that invokes another skill carries the count (`invokes 1 skill`); a target that invokes none reads `n/a` in both columns — exactly like the `Bundled scripts` row above it — and no preflight section is added to it.

The **Run stats** block closes the report and the printed summary at every terminal outcome — PASS, BLOCKER, the Phase 0 early exit, and a failed prerequisite. `elapsed`, `agents`, `skills`, and `tool calls` always print (`n/a` when undetermined); `tokens` and `cost` print only where the host reported a figure and are left out entirely otherwise, never invented and never suppressing the rest of the block. Field definitions live in SKILL.md → _Run stats (mandatory)_.

## Mode 2 — conversion report

A **delegation conversion** (SKILL.md → _Two modes_) writes its own report instead of a gate diff — none of the loop's iteration bookkeeping applies to it:

```
# Delegation conversion report

Skill: skills/my-skill
Mode: 2 — delegation conversion (user-confirmed)
Target version: 1.3.0 → 2.0.0   (MAJOR — restructured workflow)

## Steps converted

| Step | Slice handed over as the worker's `Input`             | Verdict                            |
|------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| 2    | references/discovery-contract.md + the repo list      | converted                          |
| 3    | references/audit-eval-contract.md + the clone path    | converted                          |
| 5    | —                                                     | left inline — single decision      |
| 6    | —                                                     | left inline — needs the user mid-step |

## Gate re-check after conversion

| Gate                            | Before     | After      |
|---------------------------------|------------|------------|
| Gate 1 (skill-creator standard) | √ pass     | √ pass     |
| Gate 2 (asm-eval)               | 89 / min 8 | 90 / min 8 |
| SKILL.md body lines             | 349        | 305        |
```

Every converted step names its slice; every step left inline names why. Both gates are re-checked **once**, at the end — and a conversion that leaves either gate worse than it found it is **reverted**, with the delegability finding left advisory. `references/delegation-conversion.md` owns that rule and the rest of the procedure.

## BLOCKER example

Same layout as PASS — including the advisory **Predictability findings** section — plus an `## Unresolved blockers` section listing every **hard gate** check still failing with a one-line reason. Only failed gates appear here; open predictability findings stay in the advisory section and are never promoted to blockers.

```
## Unresolved blockers

- **Gate 1 — quick_validate.py**: still rejecting top-level key `architecture`. Field encodes no runtime info; author decision needed: drop it or move under metadata.
- **Gate 2 — testability** (stuck at 6/10): evaluator wants verifiable outputs; skill output is subjective prose. Author decision needed.
- **Gate 2 — safety** (stuck at 7/10): no destructive-action guardrail; add a dry-run or confirmation step.
```

The verdict line on a blocker reads:

```
Verdict: BLOCKER
Gate 1 (skill-creator standard): × failing 1 check
Gate 2 (asm-eval): overallScore 86, min category 6 (below floor)
Predictability audit: 4/7 pass, 3 advisory (non-blocking)
```

Both gate states are reported even when only one is failing — so a reviewer can see at a glance which gate is the holdup. The predictability line is informational: it never changes the verdict.
