# Prism Liquidity Agent (Hermes)

Prism is an autonomous liquidity agent for Solana Meteora DLMM pools. This skill
teaches Hermes how to query Prism, receive ACP check-ins, and remind the user to
review positions on a schedule.

## When to use

- User asks about liquidity pool management on Solana.
- User wants to start, stop, configure, or monitor the Prism trading agent.
- User says "check my Prism positions", "any alerts from Prism?", or "should I rebalance?"
- Prism sent a check-in or alert via ACP and the user replies for context.

## Quick start

```bash
# Configure (non-interactive)
prism setup --non-interactive --helius-key=$HELIUS_API_KEY

# Start with Hermes overlay enabled
export AGENTIC_MODE=true
export AGENT_RUNTIME=hermes
export AGENT_ACP_COMMAND=hermes
export AGENT_ACP_ARGS=acp
prism dev
```

## Scheduled check-ins

This skill declares a Hermes blueprint that runs every hour. It should:

1. Call `prism status --message` for a messaging-friendly summary.
2. Summarize the result in 3-5 bullets.
3. Highlight any critical or warning alerts first.
4. Ask the user if they want to review positions in detail.

## On-demand queries

| Query | Command |
|-------|---------|
| Full JSON status | `prism status --json` |
| Messaging summary | `prism status --message` |
| Open positions | `curl -s http://127.0.0.1:18790/positions` |
| Recent decisions | `curl -s http://127.0.0.1:18790/decisions` |

## Decision flow

For each pool on each scan cycle:

1. Fetch pool state and bin array from Meteora via Helius RPC.
2. Compute metrics: fee/IL ratio, volume authenticity, bin utilization, TVL velocity.
3. Apply decision rules: EXIT → REBALANCE → HOLD → ENTER.
4. Run risk gates: confidence, max positions, allocation cap.
5. Execute in paper or live mode.

## Alert priorities

When Prism sends an alert through ACP, surface it according to priority:

- `critical` — immediate notification (TVL collapse, trailing stop, stop-loss).
- `warning` — batched or quiet notification (volume auth drop, fee/IL drop, large unrealized loss).
- `info` — included in the next hourly summary (ENTER, REBALANCE).
