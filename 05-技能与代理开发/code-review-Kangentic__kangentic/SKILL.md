# Code Review

Review the changes that make up this branch's work - commits on the branch **plus** staged, unstaged, and new untracked files in the working tree (the diff from the base branch through the working tree) - for quality, correctness, and project conventions, then apply every safely-fixable finding.

## Modes

- **Default** (`/code-review`) - review, then immediately apply every safely-fixable finding, re-run typecheck, commit this pass's own work locally (never pushed), and report `Changes Applied` + `Skipped (with reason)`.
- **Review-only** (`/code-review review-only`) - findings table + Verdict footer only, no edits applied.

The skill reads `$ARGUMENTS`, which may carry up to two independent tokens in any order:
- `review-only` - skip the Apply Phase, Re-typecheck, and commit steps (it writes nothing at all) and emit the legacy Verdict footer instead of the Changes/Skipped report.
- a **base ref** (any token that is not `review-only`, e.g. `origin/main`, `develop`, or a commit SHA) - overrides the auto-detected base branch the diff is scoped against (see Step 3). Mirrors `claude ultrareview origin/main`. A base ref is diff-*scoping* metadata, not author intent - it never tells the reviewer what the change was "supposed" to do (see "Reviewer independence").

**User-provided arguments (if any):** $ARGUMENTS

**One uniform path.** This skill runs as a thin **driver** in the main loop. Every run - regardless of diff size - does the same thing: mechanical pre-flight, gather the diff, **fan out independent reviewer subagents in parallel** (via the `Agent` tool), then **synthesize and verify their findings in the main agent**, and (default mode) apply every safely-fixable finding. There is no size gate and no separate "heavy" path. The fan-out scales naturally with the change: the universal dimension finders always run, and the domain auditors are gated by changed-file type, so a one-file change fires few finders and a broad refactor fires many. This mirrors the recommended orchestrator-worker pattern (a lead agent fans out parallel review subagents and synthesizes their results).

### Reviewer independence

`/code-review` always runs in a **fresh, isolated session** with no prior conversation or generation history (the board spawns the review session `isolated` + `always_spawn_new`; see `.claude/rules/board-config-parity.md`). The reviewing agent therefore did not write the code under review and has no memory of intending anything by it, so it is an independent reviewer **by construction**. Judge the diff strictly on its own merits - correctness, conventions, and the criteria below - and do **not** assume the author's intent was correct; that a change exists is not evidence it is right. The parallel finder subagents each receive only the change itself - the review pack's change-marked sections, never any generation reasoning - and re-derive expected behavior independently. The main agent then **verifies each finding against the actual code**: it reads the cited lines, confirms the issue is real, treats "the author clearly meant X" as inadmissible, and when uncertain **refutes** (drops) the finding rather than waving it through on assumed intent.

### Not the same as `/code-review ultra`

`ultra` is a Claude Code **built-in** that launches a multi-agent review in the **cloud** - user-initiated, billed, and not self-launchable by this skill. This project skill (`/code-review`) is an **in-session, local** reviewer: it fans out parallel read-only subagents via the `Agent` tool and synthesizes their findings in the main loop. Use `ultra` for a deep cloud audit on demand; this skill for the automatic, auto-fixing local pass. They are complementary, not unified - there is no attempt to share code between them.

## Instructions (driver)

The skill is a thin driver that runs in the main loop. All commands below run from the **current working directory** - never use `cd <path> && git ...` (triggers an unbypasable security prompt); use `git -C <path>` if you must target another directory. If the CWD is a worktree, git operates on it automatically.

1. **Pre-flight typecheck.** Run `npm run typecheck` to check for type errors. Any type errors are **highest-priority findings** - they represent potential runtime crashes. Include them in the review output even if they are in files not touched by the current diff.
2. **Pre-flight HMR vitest.** Run `npx vitest run tests/unit/hmr-resync.test.ts` (fast, ~150ms). This enforces the three mechanical HMR-parity invariants: every IPC-backed store has its `load*` / `sync*` registered in `App.tsx`'s `vite:afterUpdate` handler; every top-level mutable module state under `src/renderer/stores/` or `src/renderer/utils/` either preserves itself via `import.meta.hot.dispose(` or carries a `// hmr-safe:` directive; every `<DndContext>` has `key={...HmrGeneration}`. A failure here is a **Critical** finding (dev-mode regression that production users won't see but dogfooders will mistake for a real bug).
3. **Resolve the base branch.** Agents in this workflow sometimes commit during the working session, sometimes leave changes in the working tree, sometimes both - so the review scope is the full delta from the base branch through the working tree, the same surface `claude ultrareview` reviews. Resolve the base ref in this order, each its own Bash call, first hit wins:
   1. An explicit ref in `$ARGUMENTS` (the token that is not `review-only`), e.g. `origin/main` or a branch/SHA. Authoritative - use it verbatim.
   2. The repo default branch: `git symbolic-ref --short refs/remotes/origin/HEAD` (yields e.g. `origin/main`).
   3. Fallback locals: `git rev-parse --verify --quiet refs/heads/main`, then (if that fails) `git rev-parse --verify --quiet refs/heads/master`.
   If none resolve (no remote, no `main`/`master`), set base to empty and review the working tree only - note "base branch undetermined; reviewed working-tree changes only" in the Summary.
4. **Gather the diff (each command its own Bash call).** Capture all three layers for the driver's own use: the signature delta, the empty-diff check, the `--stat` summary, and `preexistingDirty` below. Finders never see this output; the pack script gathers the same layers itself.
   - **Committed-vs-base:** `git diff <base>...HEAD` and `git diff <base>...HEAD --stat` (three-dot = changes since the branch diverged from base). Skip when base is empty; an empty result otherwise just means no committed divergence, not an error.
   - **Uncommitted (staged + unstaged):** `git diff HEAD` and `git diff HEAD --stat` (`git diff HEAD` captures index + working tree in one command).
   - **Untracked new files:** `git ls-files --others --exclude-standard`. No diff shows these, but they are part of the change: `Read` each listed file so the signature delta below covers its exports. The pack script packs them itself, as sections in which every line is marked added.
   If the committed diff, the uncommitted diff, **and** the untracked list are all empty, emit "No changes to review." and stop (the script prints `NO CHANGES:` on the same condition). Compute the compact **signature delta** from these diffs and the untracked files (the integration finder consumes it; see "## Finders"). `changedFiles` comes from the build script's `paths:` line once it has run (below) - never from `--stat` output, which truncates long paths.

   **Record `preexistingDirty`** = the union of `git diff HEAD --name-only` and the untracked list: everything already dirty before this pass touched anything. Step 8 subtracts it to decide what it may commit. This is deliberately **narrower than `changedFiles`**, which also includes the committed-vs-base paths - conflating the two makes Step 8's set difference empty, so nothing would ever commit.

   **Use `--name-only`, never the `--stat` paths, for this set.** `--stat` abbreviates a long path to fit its column budget (`src/renderer/components/sidebar/project-sidebar/SidebarCommandTerminalIndicator.tsx`, already in this repo at 83 chars, renders as `.../sidebar/project-sidebar/SidebarCommandTerminalIndicator.tsx`). Step 8 compares against `git diff HEAD --name-only`, which never truncates, so a `--stat`-derived entry would fail to string-match its own full path, drop out of the subtraction, and get committed - the precise outcome this design exists to prevent. Keep the `--stat` capture for the human-readable summary only. This rule now guards the Step 8 dirty set alone: `changedFiles` no longer passes through `--stat` at all, since it comes from the script's `paths:` line.

   **Persist it immediately, do not just remember it.** `scripts/build-review-pack.mjs` (next paragraph) writes the list to `.kangentic/REVIEW_PREEXISTING_DIRTY.tmp` from the same gather; confirm the file exists, and only write it yourself (one path per line, `Write` tool) if the script was unavailable. Step 8 is many steps, an up-to-11-subagent fan-out, and a whole Apply Phase later, so this value has to survive a context compaction in between. If it does not survive, the set difference silently UNDER-counts and Step 8 commits the task agent's unfinished work - the exact outcome this design exists to prevent. `.kangentic/` is gitignored, so the file never stages itself and needs no cleanup.

   **Build the shared review pack (gather once, read N times).** Run `node scripts/build-review-pack.mjs <base>` (one Bash call; omit `<base>` when the base is empty). The script writes two files under the gitignored `.kangentic/` and prints only a short summary; verify both exist. `REVIEW_PACK.tmp.md` is the pack: a `Total lines: <N>` header, a one-line format legend, a table of contents with an exact start line for every changed file, then one section per changed file, largest churn first. Every body line is `<marker><line number><tab><text>` with `+` added, ` ` unchanged, and `-` removed (blank number, shown in place before the line that follows it), so each changed line appears exactly once and every citation is a working-tree line number. A file whose full body fits under the 200KB body cap is `## Full file:` or, windowed at 20 lines of context, `## Partial file:`; every other readable file is `## Changed hunks:`, the same windows at 3 lines of context. A file too large to read (over 1MB) that still has parsed hunks gets that same heading at 0 lines of context, and says so in the heading. A hunk section that alone exceeds the 100KB per-file cap becomes a one-line `## Changed hunks omitted:` stub and is listed under `## Not included (read on demand)`, as is any binary file and any oversized file the parse found no hunks for; a hunk-tier file is never listed there, because it already carries every changed line. Deleted, renamed-only, mode-only, and reverted files get a one-line section. There is no separate diff. `REVIEW_PREEXISTING_DIRTY.tmp` is the dirty list from the same gather. Which files get a body is decided on plain full-body cost, so neither windowing nor the marker format ever displaces a file the pack would otherwise carry. If the script is missing (older checkout), write the dirty list by hand per the rules below and give the finders the changed-file list with no pack path; never hand-build a pack, which is the `Write`-tool cost the next rule forbids. This exists because the 2026-08-29 audit (`docs/code-review-fanout-audit.md`) measured each finder independently re-gathering the diff (50-78k tokens each) and re-reading the same changed files (38% of all Read bytes duplicated): the pack pays that cost once. Two rules protect the savings: the pack is delivered as a FILE PATH, never embedded in finder prompts and never written through the `Write` tool (both re-bill the pack as driver output tokens - ~100k tokens at Opus rates for a 200KB pack - which is why the script does the writing); and `.kangentic/` is gitignored, so neither tmp file ever stages or needs cleanup.

   **Take `changedFiles` from the script's `paths:` line.** The summary block prints two distinct lines, and only the second carries paths:

   ```
     changed files: 6 (committed 0, uncommitted 4, untracked 2)
     paths: src/main/db/migrations.ts, src/renderer/App.tsx, ...
   ```

   `changedFiles` = that comma-separated list, verbatim. It is the script's own `changedFiles` array - the deduped union of all three layers, in full untruncated form - so it needs no reconstruction and cannot disagree with what the pack was built from. Read the `paths:` line, never the `changed files:` count line above it (counts, not paths), and never the pack's `## Contents` TOC. The TOC now lists every changed file too, but it is a navigation aid for finders, not a contract: reading it means opening the pack in the driver (billing the whole pack as driver input) and parsing paths back out of markdown labels, and every path dropped from `changedFiles` silently un-gates a domain auditor whose glob it matched (a missing `src/main/db/migrations.ts` skips `migration-safety`; a missing `src/main/pty/**` skips `platform-guard`) while the review still reports success. The `paths:` line is the one output the script promises for this purpose, which is exactly why it is the source.

   **Known limit of the format:** the paths are joined with `, `, so a changed file whose own path contains a comma-space would split into two phantom entries - one matching no auditor glob, the other under-gating. Git permits commas in paths, this repo has none, and the format is shared with the sibling repos, so do not redesign it here; if a path ever looks wrong in `changedFiles`, cross-check it against `git diff HEAD --name-only` before trusting the split.
5. **Fan out reviewer subagents (the `Agent` tool, ALL in ONE message so they run concurrently).** Every finder is a **read-only** subagent in its own fresh context window; only the driver (main loop) mutates the working tree, in the Apply Phase. Give each finder the changed-file list and the absolute path to `.kangentic/REVIEW_PACK.tmp.md`, with this instruction: load the pack FIRST and in FULL, in sequential `Read` calls with explicit `offset`/`limit` (its first line states the total line count; the `Read` tool returns at most 2000 lines per call, so a pack of N lines takes exactly ceil(N/2000) calls - do not re-read overlapping ranges); treat the pack's sections as the authoritative record of WHAT changed (the working tree stays the record of what the code is); do NOT run the git gather yourself; do NOT re-`Read` any file whose full body is in the pack; and STAY ON YOUR CRITERIA - the pack is the review surface, so do not spend calls re-verifying repo state outside your checklist (the A/B validation measured a finder giving back the entire saving by wandering into out-of-scope verification). Reading beyond the pack is for your criteria only: callers, rule files, tests, the `## Not included` files. Tell the finder what the section kinds guarantee, or it will re-read the file and give the saving back: every line carries a marker (`+` added, ` ` unchanged, `-` removed in place with a blank number) and its exact working-tree line number, so a citation from any section is correct, and a removed line is cited by the numbered line after it; `## Partial file:` carries EVERY changed hunk with 20 lines of context and `## Changed hunks:` the same with 3, with the unchanged runs between windows replaced by a marked, line-numbered gap (`..... 954 unchanged lines omitted (72-1025) .....`), so being windowed is not by itself a reason to re-`Read` a file - only a criterion that genuinely needs code inside a gap is. Every finder prompt also carries: a 3-6 line NEUTRAL summary of what the change does (mechanism only - phrase it as "context, not a licence to assume the author was right", per Reviewer independence) so the finder does not burn reads orienting itself; the instruction to end its final message with `Reads beyond the pack:` and one line per file it Read outside the pack (path and the criterion that needed it), or `none`; and the single-command Bash tool rule verbatim for any Bash-capable finder. Never hand a finder a raw diff inline and never hand it the Step 4 gather commands: the 2026-08-29 audit measured both variants costing each finder tens of thousands of tokens that the pack now pays once. The one exception is the integration finder, which gets ONLY the signature delta (below), not the pack. See "## Finders" for the exact set, the gates, the per-finder criteria, and the required return shape. The universal dimension finders always run; the domain auditors run only when their changed-file glob matches.
6. **Synthesize + verify (main agent).** Collect every finder's findings. For each, **verify it against the actual code** - read the cited `file:line` (for a removed line, the pack section that shows it, since the working tree no longer does), confirm the issue is real, and refute (drop) anything the code does not substantiate or that cannot be stated falsifiably (judge the code, not assumed intent). Dedup findings the same issue surfaced from multiple dimensions (e.g. an `any` flagged by both correctness and conventions), keeping the highest severity and clearest recommendation. Fold in the pre-flight signals: Step 1 type errors as Critical rows; a Step 2 vitest failure as a Critical row with the assertion message verbatim. Sort by severity. If a finder returned nothing usable (it errored or came back empty), note the dropped dimension in the Summary. Tally every finder's `Reads beyond the pack:` lines and the script's `pack:` summary line (size, hunk sections, stubbed) for the Summary's Pack line: that is the per-review record of whether the pack's context width and per-file cap are right.
7. **Apply Phase + Re-typecheck** (skip both in `review-only` mode). Apply every safely-fixable finding with `Edit`/`Write` (each fix is its own atomic unit - skip-with-reason on failure, keep the others), then re-run `npm run typecheck` (and the Step 2 vitest if an HMR fix landed). If a fix introduces a new type error, revert that specific edit and move the finding to `Skipped` with reason `"Fix introduced type error: <message>"`; do not roll back unrelated fixes. The Apply Phase also **fills coverage holes**: for each red-green hole the coverage finder reports on diff-introduced behavior, delegate to the `test-builder` agent to author the test (unit/UI written and run scoped to green; E2E flagged, not written inline). See "## Apply Phase".
8. **Commit the pass** (skip in `review-only` mode, which writes nothing). Commit this pass's own work so the worktree returns to clean and the next agent inherits an attributed commit instead of a mystery. See "## Committing the pass" for the set rule, the exact commands, and the mixed-authorship case.
9. Emit the **Output Format** below.

## Finders

The driver spawns all finders as **read-only** `Agent` subagents **in a single message** so they run in parallel (the orchestrator-worker fan-out). The universal dimension finders always run; the domain auditors are **gated by changed-file globs** and each is its own registered auditor agent, spawned via `subagent_type` - it loads its own domain skill and runs its checklist, so do not duplicate that checklist in the prompt. Findings come back as **text** (the `Agent` tool returns the subagent's final message, so there is no enforced schema): each finder MUST return a structured list, one block per finding with `severity`, `category`, `location` (`file:line`), `finding`, and `recommendation`, plus the falsifiable triple (`triggeringInput`, `codePath`, `testGap`) for every Correctness/Critical finding.

| Finder | `subagent_type` | Run | Gate (changed-file glob / hunk) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Correctness / Performance / Maintainability / Best-Practices+Conventions | `review-finder` (seed with the matching Review Criteria slice, incl. the "no agent-specific code outside `adapters/`" rule, `any`, shorthand, external-parser fixture) | ALWAYS (one finder per dimension) | - |
| Cross-file integration (signatures only) | `review-finder` (special prompt below) | ALWAYS when `changedFiles > 1` | - |
| Test coverage (red-green) | `review-finder` (seed with the red-green coverage criteria below) | ALWAYS when the diff changes behavioral source under `src/`, `scripts/`, or `packages/` (self-skips docs-only / test-only / pure-styling diffs) | - |
| IPC consistency | `ipc-auditor` | GATED | `ipc-channels.ts`, `types.ts`, `preload.ts`, `src/main/ipc/handlers/**`, `tests/ui/mock-electron-api.js`, `src/renderer/stores/*-store.ts` |
| HMR parity | `hmr-parity` | GATED | `src/renderer/stores/**`, `src/renderer/utils/**`, `src/renderer/App.tsx`, or any hunk with `<DndContext`/`import.meta.hot`/a new top-level renderer `let` |
| Cross-platform | `platform-guard` | GATED | `src/main/pty/**`, `src/main/agent/**`, `src/main/git/**`, `shell-resolver.ts`, `command-builder.ts`, `worktree-manager.ts`, `paths.ts`, `useTerminal.ts`, or any hunk using `path.join`/`fs.rmSync`/`child_process`/an em-dash |
| Session/PTY lifecycle | `session-debugger` | GATED | `session-manager.ts`, `session-queue.ts`, `transition-engine.ts`, `tasks.ts` (handleTaskMove), `session-store.ts`, `TerminalPanel.tsx`, `TaskDetailDialog.tsx` |
| Migration/schema | `migration-safety` | GATED | `src/main/db/migrations.ts`, `src/main/db/repositories/**`, `src/shared/types.ts` (schema interfaces), `src/main/db/database.ts` |

**Explicit, falsifiable criteria (this is the point of splitting).** Each finder prompt must enumerate concrete, falsifiable criteria - never a vague lens like "review for performance." Embed the matching Review Criteria sub-bullets verbatim for the universal finders; the gated finders inherit their auditor's explicit checklist. Every finding must carry a specific `location` (`file:line`) and a concrete `recommendation`. **Correctness / Critical findings must supply the falsifiable triple:** `triggeringInput` (the specific input that triggers the failure), `codePath` (the failing path), and `testGap` (why existing tests miss it). A finding that cannot be stated falsifiably should not be raised.

**Cross-file integration pass - signatures only (stays cheap).** The single-file finders cannot see interactions. The driver computes a compact "diff interface delta" from its own Step 4 diffs alone - **no file bodies, no pack** - and passes only that to the integration finder:

- `changedExports` - added/changed/removed exported signatures
- `typeDeltas` - interface/type member changes (e.g. a field becoming required)
- `newIpcChannels` - new channel constants in `ipc-channels.ts`
- `importChanges` - added/removed import edges between changed files
- `storeShapeMutations` - new/removed Zustand store fields

It answers questions the per-file finders structurally cannot: a new IPC channel constant with no handler/preload/mock layer touched (7-layer drift); `Task` gained a required field but no migration changed; an export's signature changed but a caller in another changed file still passes the old shape. Input is O(signatures) - a few hundred tokens regardless of diff size - so this pass is roughly constant cost and does not reintroduce long-context degradation. **The driver computes the delta itself and the finder never receives the pack path or gather commands**: in the #568 review the driver delegated the gathering and the "signatures only" finder read 254k tokens of file bodies, 500x its design budget. Its prompt keeps the repo-wide removed-surface `Grep` duty (that needs `Grep`, not file bodies).

**Removed / renamed surface (correctness + integration finders).** When the diff **deletes or renames** an exported symbol, a string constant, a wire-format token, an enum member, or a config key, a repo-wide search is the only way to catch survivors: the type checker cannot see string-keyed contracts, references in non-typechecked `.js`, or test files that reconstruct the old form as string literals. So for each removed/renamed identifier in the signature delta, the correctness and integration finders must `Grep` the **whole repo (including `tests/`, `docs/`, and `.js`)** and flag any surviving reference outside the diff as a finding. (This class produced the only blocking findings in a recent review - two test files outside the diff still emitted a removed directive format that `tsc` happily passed.)

**Test coverage - the red-green pass.** A dedicated coverage finder runs in the same parallel fan-out whenever the diff changes behavioral source under `src/`, `scripts/`, or `packages/` (it self-skips docs-only, test-only, and pure-styling diffs). The gate is the code, not the directory: a `scripts/` change with a `tests/unit/` file behind it is exactly as reviewable as one under `src/`, and reading the gate as `src/`-only would have skipped the finder that added five tests to the review-pack rewrite. It is **read-only** like every other finder; the tests it identifies are written in the Apply Phase by the `test-builder` agent (see "## Apply Phase"). Its single falsifiable question, asked per behaviorally-significant change in the diff:

> Is there a test that would **fail if this change were reverted**?

If not, it reports a **coverage hole**: the `location`, the specific behavior left unverified, why the existing tests miss it (commonly: the line is executed but its effect is never asserted - the exact gap that let an activity-engine seed ship untested), and a **suggested tier** (unit / UI / E2E) as a hint only. Its read slice is the narrowest of any finder: the pack (which already carries the changed implementation AND changed tests) plus additional TEST files only - its question is answered by tests, so it never reads unchanged implementation bodies beyond the pack. It does NOT re-derive the tier rules or write anything: the authoritative tier classification and the authoring belong to `test-builder` in the Apply Phase, so there is one source of truth for tiering. Scope holes to behavior the diff **introduced or changed** - pre-existing untested code is a separate `/test write` task. Pure refactors with no behavior change, styling, and docs produce no holes.

If a finder errors or returns nothing usable, the review proceeds on the surviving dimensions; note any dropped dimension in the Summary.

## Review Criteria

### Correctness
- Logic errors, off-by-one mistakes, null/undefined risks
- Missing error handling or unhandled promise rejections
- Race conditions or incorrect async/await usage

### Performance
- Unnecessary allocations, re-renders, or repeated work
- Missing memoization where expensive computation occurs
- Inefficient data structures or algorithms

### Maintainability
- Readability: unclear naming, overly complex expressions
- Duplication that should be extracted
- Premature abstractions or over-engineering

### Best Practices
- TypeScript strict mode compliance - **no `any` in new code**. Use proper types from `src/shared/types.ts`, `unknown` with type guards, or generic constraints. Flag any new `any` or `as any` cast as a finding.
- **External-input parsers need a real-shape fixture test.** When code parses input from outside the TypeScript boundary (`JSON.parse` of file contents, IPC payloads from external CLIs, network responses, child-process stdout) and dispatches on string-literal field comparisons, flag it as a finding unless there is a regression test that replays a real (sanitized) sample of the external format. Type-safety stops at the parse boundary. TypeScript will happily narrow `unknown` to a union you declared, even when the runtime shape has drifted. Runtime fixtures are the type system on the other side. See `tests/fixtures/codex-rollout-event-msg.jsonl` + `tests/unit/codex-session-history-parser.test.ts` for the canonical pattern.
- **No shorthand variable names** in new or changed code. Use full, descriptive names: `session` not `sess`, `currentIndex` not `curIdx`, `previousValue` not `prev`. Applies to variables, parameters, callback args, refs.
- Security: injection risks, unsanitized input
- Proper error handling at system boundaries

### Project Conventions (source of truth: `.claude/rules/`)

These are summarized for review convenience; the authoritative, enforced versions live in `.claude/rules/*.md` (each names its test and/or auditor agent).

- Single-command bash calls only (no `&&`, `||`, `|`, `;` chaining) - see `.claude/rules/bash-single-command.md`
- House writing style in every piece of authored prose the change adds or rewrites: comments, docs, README, UI copy, and the PR body this pass writes. No em-dashes, en-dashes, `--` as a separator, or curly quotes; no model vocabulary or puffery; sentence-case headings; active voice; say what it does, not how it feels - see `.claude/rules/writing-style.md`. Judge only what the change touches; pre-existing prose is out of scope by that rule's own terms. This line is the docs backstop for the judgment half of the rule. `platform-guard` (see "## Finders") flags dashes and its gate does fire on an em-dash in any hunk, but it checks characters only, so a docs-only or markdown-only change reaches no other reviewer for vocabulary, sentence construction, and voice.
- Lucide React icons only (no inline SVGs)
- `data-testid` and `data-swimlane-name` attributes for test selectors
- Zustand stores with IPC bridge pattern
- IPC channels defined in `src/shared/ipc-channels.ts`
- Dialogs dismiss via `BaseDialog`'s structural Escape (registered display-only as `dialog.dismiss` in the `KEYBINDINGS` registry); flag a new ad-hoc `addEventListener('keydown')` shortcut outside the registry - see `.claude/rules/keybindings-registry.md`
- Shared UI primitives: use `Select` (no raw `<select>`), `CountBadge` for counts, `ConfirmDialog` for confirmations; min font `text-[11px]`; avoid hover-only controls; settings/UI copy is one sentence of about 110 characters, never opens with a rhetorical question, carries only what is essential AND non-obvious, and holds no raw hex/byte literals or platform-specific justification for a universal default - see `.claude/rules/ui-conventions.md`
- A choice-presenting popover (menu, listbox, picker) portals to `document.body` and positions with `usePopoverPosition({ mode: 'dropdown', strategy: 'fixed' })` at `z-[2147483646]`; `z-index` never escapes an ancestor's overflow clip. Flag a new in-flow `absolute` menu, and an outside-click or keyboard-nav handler that checks only the trigger ref - see `.claude/rules/popover-escapes-clipping.md`
- Light dismiss is a DENYLIST: everything inside a `data-dismiss-layer` shell subtree closes an open task window on a clean click unless excluded. Flag a new overlay mounted INSIDE that subtree rather than as a sibling, an action cursor (`cursor-grab` / `-col-resize` / `-row-resize` / `-move`) without `data-no-dismiss`, and a hover affordance on dead space that promises an action the click will not deliver - see `.claude/rules/light-dismiss-denylist.md`
- No personal info / machine paths in committed code (repo is public) - see `.claude/rules/no-personal-info.md`
- Dev tooling build-time excluded via `__KANGENTIC_DEV__`, not runtime-toggled - see `.claude/rules/dev-tooling-build-exclusion.md`
- **No agent-specific code outside `src/main/agent/adapters/`.** Flag any branch on agent name (`agent === 'claude'`, `agent === 'droid'`, `taskAgent === '<x>'`, `switch (adapter.name)`, etc.) found in renderer code, IPC handlers, shared utilities, stores, or tests outside the `adapters/` tree. Adapter-specific copy, tooltips, capability decisions, and behavior must live with the adapter and surface through generic capability fields (e.g. `AgentAdapter.liveTelemetryUnsupported`, `AdapterRuntimeStrategy`, `AgentDetectionInfo` extensions). Suggested grep: `agent === '|taskAgent ===|adapter\.name ===` under `src/renderer/`, `src/shared/`, and `src/main/ipc/`.

### Domain-Specific Checks

Each domain is owned by a dedicated **gated auditor finder** (see "## Finders" for the gates). The auditor agent is the single source of truth for its checklist: it carries its domain skill via `skills:` preload frontmatter and/or its own agent body, and IT performs the check - the driver only spawns it. Do not restate auditor checklists here: the same no-duplication rule the finder prompts follow applies to this file (the checklists were previously mirrored in this section and drifted). One line each so the driver knows the coverage:

- `ipc-auditor` - 7-layer IPC parity, push-event hygiene, broadcast guards (preloads `ipc-bridge`)
- `session-debugger` - session state machine legality, generation guards, terminal ownership (preloads `session-lifecycle`)
- `platform-guard` - cross-platform pitfalls, shell quoting, text formatting (preloads `cross-platform`)
- `hmr-parity` - the four HMR primitives; semantic mismatches beyond the Step 2 vitest's mechanical checks (source of truth: `.claude/rules/hmr-patterns.md`; a missing pattern is High severity)
- `migration-safety` - migration idempotency, schema/TypeScript alignment, repository column coverage

## Model selection

- **Finders** (every parallel subagent, universal and gated): **Sonnet at medium effort**, pinned in agent frontmatter, never passed per spawn. The universal finders spawn as `subagent_type: "review-finder"` (`.claude/agents/review-finder.md`: `model: sonnet`, `effort: medium`, `tools: Read, Glob, Grep` - the restricted roster drops the ~22k-token tool/MCP manifest from each floor, and under the pack the finders need no Bash or git). The gated auditors carry the same `model: sonnet` + `effort: medium` in their own frontmatter, and where a domain skill exists they preload it via `skills:` (`ipc-auditor` -> `ipc-bridge`, `session-debugger` -> `session-lifecycle`, `platform-guard` -> `cross-platform`) so the domain material arrives deterministically instead of by runtime discovery. Sonnet at medium is enough because the review's depth and safety come from the **structure** - many independent finders plus main-agent verification and dedup - not from each finder being a frontier reasoner. Known limits (documented harness behavior): subagents inherit the session's extended-thinking config and advisor model with no per-subagent override; `effort` is the available lever.
- **Synthesis + verification + Apply Phase** (the driver / main loop): the **session model at its configured effort** - the most capable agent in the system. Findings are verified against the code, deduped, and turned into edits here, so the strong model is spent on the one bounded synthesis context rather than across the fan-out. Because `/code-review` runs in a fresh isolated session, this synthesis agent is an independent reviewer (see "Reviewer independence").

For a deep, no-expense-spared cloud audit, use the `ultra` built-in instead (see "Not the same as `/code-review ultra`").

## Apply Phase

Default mode applies fixes immediately after the findings table, then commits them (Step 8, see "## Committing the pass"). The commit is **local only, never pushed** - landing the branch is still `/pull-request`'s or `/merge-back`'s job.

**This edits and commits in the worktree it is reviewing, and the task agent's own unfinished work is usually already sitting there.** The board spawns this skill from the Code Review column as an `isolated` + `always_spawn_new` session, but `isolated` isolates the **conversation, not the filesystem**: the session's `cwd` is the task's own worktree, the same tree the task agent has been using (`docs/session-lifecycle.md:222` documents the shared worktree).

The two do **not** run concurrently. Entering an isolated column takes the `needsSessionSwitch` branch in `src/main/ipc/handlers/task-move.ts`, which suspends the task agent's main session and kills its PTY (`docs/session-lifecycle.md:228`, plus "one active PTY per task" at `:222`), preserving `agent_session_id` so it resumes when the card leaves. What the suspended agent leaves behind is its **uncommitted working tree** - and by the time you reach Step 8, those files are indistinguishable from your own edits. That is the whole reason Step 8 commits by set math instead of `git add -A`.

Committing the pass is also what keeps the tree legible downstream: a finished pass **normally** leaves a clean tree plus one attributed commit. Normally, not always - a fix that lands on an already-dirty path stays uncommitted by design (see "The mixed-authorship case"), so a dirty tree downstream means one of two things, not one: this pass is still in flight, or it finished and deliberately left those paths mixed. `/pull-request`'s Pre-flight Checks documents both readings.

### What gets auto-fixed

Local, mechanical, single-file or tightly-scoped edits:

- TypeScript `any` / `as any` casts -> proper type from `src/shared/types.ts`, `unknown` + type guard, or generic constraint
- Shorthand variable names -> expanded (`sess` -> `session`, `prev` -> `previousValue`, `curIdx` -> `currentIndex`)
- Em-dashes (U+2014) and `--` used as punctuation -> single dash `-` or restructured sentence
- Missing `data-testid` / `data-swimlane-name` on test selectors that the convention requires
- Single-command bash chain violations in skills/docs (`&&`, `||`, `|`, `;`) -> split into separate Bash blocks
- `cd <path> && git ...` -> `git -C <path> ...`
- Missing `{ force: true }` on Windows `fs.rmSync` in cleanup paths
- Missing `!mainWindow.isDestroyed()` guard on IPC broadcasts
- Inline SVGs -> Lucide React icon (when an obvious match exists)
- Mechanical agent-specific moves (move a string constant or capability flag into `src/main/agent/adapters/`); non-mechanical splits are skipped with reason
- One-file type fixes (narrow a return type, add a missing annotation)

### What gets skipped (with reason)

- **Architectural refactors** spanning multiple modules or changing public APIs
- **Missing test coverage on pre-existing code the diff did not touch** -> reason: `"Outside diff scope; run /test write to add"`. Coverage holes on behavior **this diff introduced** are NOT skipped - they are auto-written via `test-builder` (see "Auto-adding missing tests" below).
- **Deletion of code the human just added** -> ask first
- **Conflicting findings** -> reason: `"Conflicts with finding #N; pick one and re-run"`
- **Ambiguous renames at >5 call sites** -> reason: `"Ambiguous rename; suggest manual review"`
- **Stakeholder-input findings** (security policy choices, UX copy, log-level changes)
- **Type errors in untouched files** -> reason: `"Outside current diff scope; flag for separate task"`
- **Findings that would trip a hook the user opted out of**
- **Any fix that introduces a new type error** (auto-reverted by the re-typecheck step)

For every skip, the report includes: finding number, `file:line`, reason, and a concrete next step (run `/test write`, manual review, defer to follow-up task, etc.).

### Auto-adding missing tests (coverage holes)

When the coverage finder reports a red-green hole on behavior **this diff** introduced, the Apply Phase fills it. This is **advisory, never a hard gate**: it writes what it safely can and flags the rest; the board human still drives the column move, and `/pull-request` remains the hard CI gate behind it.

1. **Delegate to `test-builder`** (the `Agent` tool, `subagent_type: "test-builder"`) - one call per hole, or one batched call for several holes in the same area. Pass the hole's `location`, the behavior to pin, and the red-green rationale. `test-builder` owns the authoritative tier choice and the Windows/CI flake discipline, so do not pre-bake the tier - hand it the behavior and let it classify.
2. **Unit and UI tiers are written inline.** `test-builder` authors the test and runs ONLY that new file scoped (`npx vitest run <file>` or `npx playwright test <spec>`) to confirm green. Never run the full suite - that is `/pull-request`'s job on CI.
3. **E2E holes are flagged, not written inline** (a real PTY/app run is slow and flake-prone in this pass). Report them under Skipped with `"E2E coverage hole; add via /test write"`.
4. **Red-green standard.** The test must assert the post-fix behavior such that reverting the change fails it. Where the change is localized, `test-builder` may briefly toggle the fix to confirm the test goes red, then restore it.
5. If `test-builder` cannot produce a green test (ambiguous behavior, missing fixture), move the hole to Skipped with its reason. Never leave a red or `.skip` test behind.

Tests are committed with the rest of the pass (Step 8); they are new untracked files, so they always fall on the committable side of the set rule below.

## Committing the pass

Step 8, default mode only. The goal is that a finished pass leaves the worktree **clean**, with its work in one commit whose message says who wrote it.

### What may be committed

This skill deliberately reviews uncommitted work (Step 3: agents "sometimes commit during the working session, sometimes leave changes in the working tree, sometimes both"), so the tree is often **already dirty with the task agent's own unfinished work** when the pass starts. A blind `git add -A` would commit that work under a `refactor(review):` message, which is worse than leaving the tree dirty. So:

> Commit **only** what became dirty during this pass. Never `git add -A`.

Do not try to track "the files the Apply Phase edited" - there is no such value, and `test-builder` is a subagent whose test-file writes are not driver `Edit`/`Write` calls at all, so it would miss them. Use set math over git state instead, which is provable and needs no subagent cooperation. Each command is its own Bash call:

1. `git diff HEAD --name-only` - tracked files dirty now.
2. `git ls-files --others --exclude-standard` - untracked files now.
3. `currentDirty` = the union of those two. **Committable = `currentDirty` minus `preexistingDirty`**, reading `preexistingDirty` back from `.kangentic/REVIEW_PREEXISTING_DIRTY.tmp` (written at Step 4) rather than from memory. If that file is missing or unreadable, do NOT guess and do NOT fall back to `git add -A`: skip the commit, and report that the pass could not establish what it may safely commit so the user can stage it themselves.

Anything dirty now that was not dirty at Step 4 is provably this pass's work, whoever wrote it. The edge cases need no special handling: `test-builder`'s new test files are untracked now and were not before, so they commit; a fix on a path the task agent had already left dirty is in both sets, so it is excluded; a fix auto-reverted by the re-typecheck step returns that file to clean, drops out of `currentDirty`, and is never committed.

If Committable is empty, skip the commit silently and go to the Output Format.

### How to commit

1. Stage each committable path explicitly: `git add <path>`, **one path per Bash tool call** (`.claude/rules/bash-single-command.md` forbids chaining).
2. Write the message to `.kangentic/COMMIT_MSG.tmp` with the **Write** tool - the relative path, resolved from CWD. `.kangentic/` is gitignored, so it never stages itself and needs no cleanup. Never write to `.git/`; in a worktree `.git` is a file, not a directory.
3. `git commit <path1> <path2> ... -F .kangentic/COMMIT_MSG.tmp` - **pass every committable path as a pathspec.** One command with several positional args, so it still satisfies `.claude/rules/bash-single-command.md`. Never use `$(...)` or backtick substitution (triggers a safety prompt).

   **A bare `git commit -F` here is a real bug, not a shortcut.** With no pathspec, `git commit` commits the ENTIRE INDEX. The task agent routinely pauses with work already staged (`git add somefile.ts`, no commit yet); Step 4 correctly puts that file in `preexistingDirty` and Step 8 correctly excludes it from Committable, and then a bare commit sweeps it in anyway because it was sitting in the index the whole time - defeating the set math completely. The pathspec form commits only the named paths and leaves a pre-staged file untouched and still staged. As a cheap assertion, `git diff --cached --name-only` should equal Committable immediately before you commit; if it does not, stop rather than commit.

The message is conventional, and the scope is literally `review`: `fix(review):`, `refactor(review):`, or `test(review):`, picked by primary change type. The body lists what was fixed, one line per finding. `allowed-tools` already grants `Bash(git:*)`, so nothing new is needed there.

**Use `review` as the scope even though scope usually names a code area.** A review pass is routinely spread across every area it reviewed - one real pass touched migrations, git, IPC handlers, the transition engine, and the renderer at once - so no single area scope is honest, and the useful grouping is which pass produced the commit. It also makes the commit greppable, which the reading side relies on: `/pull-request`'s Pre-flight tells the next agent to expect exactly a `*(review)` commit and to leave it alone rather than squash or reword it.

**Never push. Never amend an existing commit.** Amending would rewrite the task agent's commit and claim this pass as part of it, which is the misattribution this whole design exists to prevent.

### The mixed-authorship case

When a fix lands on a path that was already dirty, that fix stays uncommitted, mixed into the task agent's work in the same file. The hunks cannot be separated safely, so do not try. Instead the footer must **list those paths by name** - "some fixes left uncommitted" is not enough, because the next agent inherits a dirty tree and needs to know exactly which files hold two authors' work before it stages anything.

**The same split can strand a test.** A coverage-hole test is a new untracked file, so it always falls on the committable side; if the behavior it pins lives in a file that stays uncommitted, the commit lands a test with no corresponding fix in its own history. The working tree is fine (the fix is physically present, just uncommitted), but that commit read in isolation - a bisect, or a later `git stash` of only the dirty paths - is not. When it happens, either move that test to `Skipped` for this pass, or commit it and say so explicitly in the footer: "test committed without its target fix (see the mixed-authorship list)."

## Output Format

### Findings Table

Present all findings in a single table, sorted by severity (Critical first, then High, Medium, Low):

| # | Severity | Category | Location | Finding | Recommendation |
|---|----------|----------|----------|---------|----------------|
| 1 | Critical | Correctness | `src/main/foo.ts:42` | Brief description of the issue | **Must fix** - what to change and why |
| 2 | High | Best Practices | `src/renderer/Bar.tsx:15` | Brief description | **Should fix** - suggested change |
| 3 | Medium | Performance | `src/main/baz.ts:88` | Brief description | **Consider** - tradeoff explanation |
| 4 | Low | Maintainability | `src/shared/types.ts:10` | Brief description | **Optional** - nice-to-have improvement |

#### Severity levels

| Severity | Meaning | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **Critical** | Type errors, runtime crashes, data loss, security vulnerabilities | **Must fix** before merging |
| **High** | Logic bugs, missing error handling, `any` types, race conditions | **Should fix** - real risk of breakage |
| **Medium** | Performance issues, convention violations, unclear code | **Consider** - improves quality but not blocking |
| **Low** | Style nits, minor duplication, optional improvements | **Optional** - fix if touching the area anyway |

### Default-mode footer

After the findings table, run the Apply Phase and then emit:

```
### Changes Applied (N)

| # | File:Line | What changed |
|---|-----------|--------------|
| 1 | src/main/foo.ts:42 | Replaced `any` cast with `Task` type |
| 2 | src/renderer/Bar.tsx:15 | Renamed `sess` -> `session` (3 sites) |

Re-typecheck: PASS

### Tests Added (K)

| # | Test file | Tier | Behavior pinned (red-green) |
|---|-----------|------|------------------------------|
| 1 | tests/unit/activity-engine.test.ts | unit | seeded 'thinking' spawn is reclaimed to idle by the stale-thinking watchdog |

Scoped run: PASS

### Skipped (M)

| # | File:Line | Why | Next step |
|---|-----------|-----|-----------|
| 5 | src/main/baz.ts:88 | Architectural refactor - splits handler across 3 files | Design review |
| 7 | tests/e2e/Qux.spec.ts | E2E coverage hole (real PTY) - not written inline | Run `/test write` |

### Committed

`refactor(review): <subject>` as `<sha>` - P files.

Then the tree status, which is COMPUTED, not boilerplate: print `Worktree clean.` only when nothing
was left behind. If anything was, print `N file(s) left uncommitted (mixed authorship).` instead -
never print "clean" directly above a non-empty list, which is the contradiction this line exists to
avoid.

Left uncommitted (already dirty before this pass, so they hold two authors' work):
- src/main/qux.ts

### Summary
- Files reviewed: N
- Findings: A critical, B high, C medium, D low
- Auto-fixed: N
- Tests added: K (plus E E2E coverage holes flagged)
- Skipped: M
- Pack: <size>KB, <L> lines, <B> bodies (<W> windowed), <H> hunk sections, <S> stubbed (<paths, or none>); <F> finders; reads beyond the pack: <R> (<path: finder, criterion>, or none). Copy this row into `docs/code-review-fanout-audit.md` section 14.5.
- Verdict: **Clean** (or **Needs revision** - M skipped findings require human judgment)
```

Edge cases the footer must handle cleanly:
- No diff at all (committed-vs-base, uncommitted, and untracked all empty) -> short-circuit at the diff-gather step (Step 4) with `"No changes to review."`
- Diff exists, zero quality findings -> skip the fix step, but STILL run the coverage pass; if it reports holes on diff-introduced behavior, write them (Tests Added) and report. Only when there are also no coverage holes, emit `"No findings, nothing to fix."`
- Re-typecheck FAILS -> show the error block, list which fix was reverted, mark Verdict as **Needs revision**
- Committable set empty at Step 8 (no fixes applied, or every fix landed on an already-dirty path) -> omit the `### Committed` block entirely, but STILL list the mixed-authorship paths and say the worktree was left dirty, so the reader knows the clean-tree handoff did not happen
- Committable NON-empty while some fixes also landed on already-dirty paths (the common mixed case) -> emit `### Committed` for what did land, and do NOT report "Worktree clean.": print `N file(s) left uncommitted (mixed authorship)` and list them, because the tree is by definition not clean
- Step 2 hmr-resync vitest FAILS -> the failure output is itself a Critical finding. Include the failing assertion's message verbatim in the findings table, attempt the auto-fix in the Apply Phase (e.g. add the missing store re-sync call to `App.tsx`, add the missing `key={hmrGeneration}` to the new `<DndContext>`, add a `// hmr-safe:` directive or `dispose` block to the new module-scope state), then re-run the vitest in addition to typecheck during the Re-typecheck step. If the test still fails after the fix attempt, mark Verdict as **Needs revision**.

### Review-only-mode footer

When `review-only` is in `$ARGUMENTS`, skip the Apply Phase and the Step 8 commit, and emit the legacy footer:

- **Files reviewed:** N
- **Findings:** N critical, N high, N medium, N low
- **Verdict:** one of:
  - **Ship it** - no findings, or only low-severity items
  - **Minor issues** - medium findings worth addressing, no blockers
  - **Needs revision** - critical or high-severity findings that should be resolved

## Allowed Tools

The driver uses `Bash` (git/npm/npx only) for pre-flight + diff gathering, the `Agent` tool to fan out the read-only finder subagents, and owns `Read`, `Edit`, `Write`, `Glob`, `Grep` for verification and the Apply Phase. `review-only` mode performs no edits (the finders are read-only regardless). Always run commands from the project root - no chained commands (`&&`, `||`, `|`, `;`).

**No headless `claude`, no `Workflow`.** All orchestration is in-session via the `Agent` tool. Never invoke `claude -p`, `claude --print`, `git diff | claude ...`, or any other headless `claude` shell pipeline, and do not use the `Workflow` tool - the finders are spawned directly as parallel `Agent` subagents and synthesized in the main loop.

**CRITICAL: Use `git -C <path>` for all git commands in other directories.** Never use `cd <path> && git ...` - the `cd && git` pattern triggers an unbypasable Claude Code security prompt.

**Commit this pass, and nothing else.** Step 8 commits only what became dirty during this pass, so the worktree returns to clean with the work attributed. Never `git add -A`, never touch work that was already uncommitted when the pass started, never amend, and **never push** - landing the branch stays `/pull-request`'s job, or `/merge-back`'s for a direct quick-push. See "## Committing the pass".
