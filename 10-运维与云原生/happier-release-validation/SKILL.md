# Happier Release Validation

This is the repository-owned entrypoint for the public release contract's
manual-only `deep` profile. It does not publish, promote, deploy, submit stores,
or create a release operation.

## Start from the target contract

From the explicit release checkout, inspect the target-owned profile and its
executable suite inventory:

```bash
node scripts/pipeline/run.mjs release-contract
node scripts/pipeline/run.mjs release-validate --profile deep --dry-run
```

`deep` is not part of normal release dispatch. This skill is its manual
entrypoint; the registry does not pretend that semantic compatibility or human
QA can be decided by a script.

For general release preparation or approval, first use the installed private
maintainer authority:

```bash
hmaint release bootstrap --repo <absolute checkout> --json
```

Read and follow the returned private skill for general release preparation or
approval. This repository skill remains the target-owned deep-certification
entrypoint only.

If `hmaint` is unavailable, stop and obtain the approved maintainer-tool
installation; do not substitute a copied release workflow or arbitrary shell
commands.

## Manual certification

1. Record the release source SHA and every independently versioned component
   changed by that source. Resolve supported stable/preview baselines to
   immutable tags/artifacts; a rolling tag is discovery only.
2. Read `docs/compatibility.md`, map only reachable old/new directions, and
   perform the target-owned suite commands for affected automatic-capable
   surfaces. Record unrun or unavailable proof as such.
3. Use the non-mutating `deep` profile in `tests-dispatch.yml` for complete
   in-repository source certification. Run credentialed live-provider scenarios
   separately through their explicit provider-contract entrypoint when the
   affected surface requires them. Native/store publication is release work,
   not certification, and must not be invoked from this skill.
   Keep editorial judgement, release-note wording, and subjective compatibility
   assessment human-reviewed; do not encode them as prose/style tests.
4. For every manual scenario, preserve practical evidence: source/baseline
   identity, command or observed user flow, result, and recovery/failure state.
   Use an existing release record when one exists; do not create a parallel
   ledger, lifecycle state, or certification authority.
5. Report passed, failed, skipped, and blocked checks to the maintainer. A
   manual certification is evidence for human approval, never the approval
   itself.

## Boundaries

- Use the canonical `scripts/pipeline/release-validation/validate-release.mjs`
  path through `scripts/pipeline/run.mjs`; do not copy its suite selection into
  this skill.
- Manual deep certification validates the release source and the existing loaded
  stack. It does not create or install local release archives; publication
  automation owns the outputs it publishes.
- Run only discriminating compatibility vectors or live flows for affected,
  reachable directions. Do not manufacture a component or platform matrix.
- Keep certification evidence in the existing release record or final handoff.
  Do not create per-run plan, tracking, ledger, lane, or workspace machinery.
- Do not write release notes, tags, GitHub releases, credentials, deploy
  branches, or store submissions from this skill.
