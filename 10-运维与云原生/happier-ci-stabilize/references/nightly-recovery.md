# Nightly recovery and work preservation

## Choose the cheapest safe recovery

| Evidence | Recovery | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Same workflow SHA; transient runner, download, read-only API, or external failure; failed job is safe to retry | Native failed-job rerun | Retains successful jobs and retries only failures/dependents |
| New workflow-control/test/validation fix; origin run is terminal; immutable candidates were individually verified; candidate/source bytes are unchanged | Dispatch nightly with `resume_run_id=<origin-run-id>` from the corrected control SHA | Reuses expensive builds/signing while re-verifying identity and rerunning downstream gates |
| Product source, packaging inputs, build scripts, dependencies, signing inputs, or candidate bytes changed | Fresh nightly | Old artifacts no longer prove the new source |
| Ambiguous mutation failure (for example HTTP failure after release PATCH/upload) | Reconcile observed remote state, then use the owning recovery-aware rerun | Blind retry could duplicate or overwrite publication |
| Origin run is still active or lacks its terminal status artifact | Wait | Resume trust intentionally requires completed evidence |

Successful sibling candidates are reusable evidence, not disposable intermediate work. Preserve them unless source, packaging, dependency, signing, or candidate bytes changed.

For 0.2 nightly, the public workflow input is defined by `.github/workflows/nightly-dev.yml`. A typical authorized dispatch is:

```bash
yarn ghops workflow run nightly-dev.yml \
  --repo happier-dev/happier \
  --ref dev \
  -f source_ref=dev \
  -f resume_run_id=<completed-origin-run-id>
```

Do not dispatch merely because this command is documented. Confirm current repository instructions, release authority, exact control SHA, origin run, and source identity first. GitHub mutations use the isolated `happier-bot` transport; never substitute a personal `gh` login when `ghops` authentication is unavailable. If the private release conductor owns the requested operation, use that conductor instead of dispatching the public workflow directly.

## Resume invariants

The resolver must prove the origin workflow/channel, terminal `happier-release-status` artifact, candidate source SHA, candidate version, and individual verification evidence. A resumed run still performs actor/source trust gates and exact artifact verification. Skipped build/sign jobs are expected evidence of reuse, not missing coverage.

A control-only fix may change workflow/test code while reusing immutable candidates only when the workflow explicitly separates trusted current control bytes from the preserved candidate source. Never execute a new control flag using an old candidate checkout that cannot support it.

## Monitoring

- Use step-level status to distinguish queueing, dependency installation, compilation, notarization, store processing, publication, and cleanup.
- Poll long operations every 5-20 minutes. Avoid repeated 30-second reads.
- A GitHub API timeout while polling is a monitoring failure, not a workflow failure.
- Do not cancel notarization, native builds, store submission, or a release mutation solely because duration is unusual.
- Compare a suspected hang with the same step's successful baseline and configured job timeout. Obtain terminal logs before changing code when live logs are unavailable.
- Cancel a superseded run only when it is already unable to satisfy the requested outcome and it blocks a corrected run; preserve useful candidate/status evidence required for resume.

## Retry boundaries

- Retry bounded read-only operations such as status lookup, artifact download, and permission lookup for transient network errors, `408`, `429`, and `5xx` responses.
- Treat authentication/authorization failures, invalid inputs, and stable not-found responses as configuration or contract failures, not transient success candidates.
- A failed publication, upload, tag update, release PATCH, or store relationship write may have succeeded remotely. Observe and reconcile the canonical remote state before retrying.
- Retry a mutation automatically only when the owning operation is proven idempotent or its reconciliation path makes the next attempt safe. Never wrap ambiguous mutations in a generic retry loop.

## Terminal proof

For a nightly, verify all applicable evidence:

- exact run SHA and attempt;
- immutable versions for CLI, HStack, server, and UI web;
- grouped immutable-candidate verifier;
- required release-validation suites;
- rolling promotions;
- desktop/mobile/Docker jobs requested by the profile;
- `Verify promoted nightly references`;
- `happier-release-status` with complete/success/verified required surfaces and terminal `published`;
- immutable and rolling tags resolving to the expected source SHA.

Report best-effort side-lane failure separately even when the workflow is terminal-green.
