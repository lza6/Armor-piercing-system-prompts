# Setup and Connectivity

## Step 1: IB Gateway or TWS

ibkr-cli talks to Interactive Brokers through a local API gateway. The user needs one of these running on their machine before anything else works:

- **IB Gateway** (recommended): lightweight, no trading UI, built specifically for API access, uses fewer system resources.
- **TWS (Trader Workstation)**: full trading platform with a graphical interface, also exposes an API.

Either one works. Recommend Gateway unless the user also wants a visual trading interface.

### Installation

Direct the user to download from IBKR's website:

- Gateway: https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/trading/ibgateway-stable.php
- TWS: https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/trading/tws-updateless-latest.php

After installing, they need to launch the application and log in with their IBKR account credentials.

### API settings

- **IB Gateway**: API is enabled by default. No action needed. Default ports — live: 4001, paper: 4002.
- **TWS**: API is **not** enabled by default. The user must go to Edit > Global Configuration > API > Settings and check "Enable ActiveX and Socket Clients". Default ports — live: 7496, paper: 7497.

### Choosing a profile

When the user hasn't specified whether they want paper or live trading, verify connectivity in priority order: `gateway-live` (4001) > `live` (7496) > `gateway-paper` (4002) > `paper` (7497). Use `ibkr doctor --api --profile <name> --json` to check each: `api_check.ok` is `true` (exit code 0) when the handshake succeeds, and it errors (exit code 4) otherwise. The first profile whose handshake succeeds is the one to use. Only default to paper if the user explicitly says they want paper trading, or if no live connection is available.

## Step 2: Install ibkr-cli

The CLI requires Python 3.10+. If the user doesn't have Python, help them install it first.

Recommended installation via pipx (isolated environment, won't interfere with other Python packages):

```bash
pipx install ibkr-cli
```

Alternative via pip:

```bash
python -m pip install ibkr-cli
```

Verify it works:

```bash
ibkr --version
```

## Step 3: Verify connectivity

The CLI automatically creates a config file with default profiles on first use — no manual initialization needed. The config file location can be found via `ibkr config-path`, and the user can edit it to customize host, port, or client_id if needed.

The four default profiles are:

| Profile         | Port | Use case              |
|-----------------|------|-----------------------|
| `paper`         | 7497 | TWS paper trading     |
| `live`          | 7496 | TWS live trading      |
| `gateway-paper` | 4002 | IB Gateway paper      |
| `gateway-live`  | 4001 | IB Gateway live       |

Help the user pick the right profile based on which application they're running (Gateway vs TWS) and which mode (paper vs live).

### Run doctor

```bash
ibkr doctor --profile gateway-paper
```

This runs a full health check — TCP reachability and API handshake. If it fails, common causes are:

- Gateway/TWS is not running — ask the user to start it
- Wrong profile — they're using a TWS profile but running Gateway, or vice versa
- API not enabled — only applies to TWS (see Step 1)
- Firewall blocking the port

Walk through these diagnostics one at a time rather than listing them all at once.

## Troubleshooting

When things go wrong, use `ibkr doctor` as the first diagnostic step. Common issues and how to resolve them:

- **"Connection refused"**: Gateway/TWS is not running, or the user selected the wrong profile (e.g., using port 4002 but TWS is on 7497)
- **"No market data"**: The user's IBKR account lacks market data subscriptions for the requested instrument. The quote command will automatically try delayed data as fallback.
- **"Client ID conflict"**: Multiple CLI processes are connecting to the same Gateway/TWS simultaneously. Advise running commands one at a time against a given profile.
- **Order rejected**: Use `--preview` first to check margin and commission before submitting. The preview output often reveals why an order would fail.
