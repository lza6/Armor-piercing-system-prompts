# Preview

Open a new terminal window running a Kangentic dev server for previewing live code changes in the current worktree.

## Instructions

1. If the user passed `--fresh` (e.g. `/preview --fresh`), run `node scripts/worktree-preview.js --fresh`. Otherwise run `node scripts/worktree-preview.js`. Forward every `--env KEY=VALUE` the user passed, verbatim and repeatable (`node scripts/worktree-preview.js --env KANGENTIC_TELEMETRY=1 --env KANGENTIC_ERROR_REPORTING=0`). That flag is the ONLY way a variable reaches the dev server: the terminal tab the launcher opens inherits the terminal host's environment, not this shell's, so a variable set in the Bash call itself is silently dropped.
2. Report the output - it will show the assigned port, PID, and a `Watch:` command.
3. If the command fails, report the error message and stop.
4. Unless the user passed `--no-watch`, or the launcher reported `PID: unknown` (the watcher cannot attach without a live PID file and would exit `1` immediately), run the printed `Watch:` command (`node scripts/worktree-preview.js --wait --port=<port> --kangentic-no-activity-hold`) as a **separate Bash call with `run_in_background: true`**. Do not poll it, do not wrap it in a `Monitor`, and do not schedule a `ScheduleWakeup` fallback - it blocks until the preview exits, and the harness delivers a `<task-notification>` with its exit code on its own.

   Run the `Watch:` line **exactly as printed**, `--kangentic-no-activity-hold` included. The script ignores that flag; Kangentic's activity engine reads it out of the command string and exempts the shell from holding the session ACTIVE. Drop it and the board shows this task as working for the preview's entire lifetime, so the user loses the signal that says which agent needs them.
5. When that notification arrives, tell the user what happened and stop offering a `--stop` command for that port:
   - exit `0` - exited cleanly (user closed the terminal, or a `--stop` you or the user ran)
   - exit `2` - crashed; point the user at the preview terminal's scrollback
   - exit `3` - force-killed or the terminal was hard-closed
   - exit `1` - the watcher couldn't attach (unlikely right after a successful launch)
   - **no exit code** (the notification says the command was `stopped` with no completion record):
     the WATCHER died, usually with a session teardown. This says nothing about the preview, so
     treat its state as UNKNOWN, not as running. Either verify before saying anything about it, or
     say nothing. Do not re-offer `--stop` on the strength of a teardown notice.

6. **Offer the `--stop` command once, when you launch the preview.** Do not append it to later
   messages about unrelated work. Repeating it every turn is noise, and because a preview the user
   already stopped leaves no notification you will see, the repeated offer is frequently just wrong.
   Re-offer only when the user asks about the preview, or when you have re-verified it is alive in
   the same turn.

7. **Never state that a preview is running from memory.** Liveness is external state that changes
   without telling you: the user can close the terminal, run `--stop`, or reboot. A launch you
   performed earlier in the conversation is not evidence it is still up. If it matters, check in
   that turn (`tasklist` / `Get-Process` on the recorded PID, or the lockfile); otherwise do not
   make the claim at all.

## Notes

- **A preview forces the cheap Claude tier.** Every preview project is seeded with
  `default_agent: claude`, `default_model: haiku`, and `default_effort: low`
  (`src/devtools/main/ephemeral-projects.ts`), so agent-driven preview testing does not bill the
  developer's subscription at the committed board's Opus tier.

  Those are Claude family names, and a model id is adapter-specific, so the project default does
  NOT follow a column or task that overrides the agent: `projectModelDefaultsApply`
  (`src/main/transition-engine/spawn-preamble.ts`) drops the project tier whenever the resolved
  agent is not the project's default agent. A Codex column in a preview therefore spawns with no
  `--model` flag and Codex's own default applies. No per-column override is needed just to make a
  non-Claude column run.

  Set a column's own model override only when you want a specific model (`gpt-5.5` for Codex),
  via the Board Manager or `kangentic_devtools_run_command` `update_column`
  `{"modelOverride": "gpt-5.5"}`. The one case that still inherits `haiku` is changing the
  preview project's OWN default agent to a non-Claude one, which leaves the seeded Claude model
  name in place.

- This script must be run from inside a `.kangentic/worktrees/` directory. It will error with a clear message if run from the project root.
- Creates a filesystem junction (Windows) or symlink (Unix) from `<worktree>/node_modules` → `<root>/node_modules` - no `npm install` or rebuild needed.
- The preview instance runs on a dynamically assigned port (starting from 5174) so it does not conflict with the root dev server on 5173.
- Each preview instance has its own empty board - board state does NOT sync between instances. Use the root instance for task management.
- When the preview terminal is closed, the worktree's `.kangentic/` and `.vite/` directories are automatically cleaned up (ephemeral mode). The node_modules junction is left in place for instant restarts.
- Multiple `/preview` invocations can run simultaneously - each gets its own port, and each gets its own watcher.
- Pass `--fresh` to launch without auto-opening a project (shows the Welcome Screen). Useful for testing the first-launch experience. Example: `/preview --fresh`
- Pass `--env KEY=VALUE` (repeatable) to set a variable in the dev server's environment; the launcher splices it into the terminal command, so it is visible in the process list and must not carry a secret. Values may not contain quotes, newlines, or `& | < > ^ %`. The analytics rig is the standing example (`docs/analytics.md`, "Local verification"): `/preview --env KANGENTIC_TELEMETRY=1 --env KANGENTIC_APTABASE_APP_KEY=A-DEV-0000000000 --env KANGENTIC_ERROR_REPORTING=0`.
- **Stopping goes through Electron's real quit path.** `--stop` writes the stop file, and `dev.js` then asks the app to quit over the inspection bridge (`POST /quit`) before falling back to a kill after 8s. So a stopped preview runs its synchronous cleanup (sessions suspended, PTYs killed, the run recorded as a clean exit) instead of being terminated with its PTY children orphaned. The kill fallback still exists for an app whose bridge is off or wedged. A graceful stop takes longer than the old kill did: once Electron has exited cleanly nothing holds the two repo clones under `.kangentic/data`, so `dev.js` actually removes them (several seconds on Windows), and the launcher waits up to 45s for that before force-killing. `--stop` returning after ten or twenty seconds is the removal finishing, not a hang.
- **Stopping a preview (restarts):** run `node scripts/worktree-preview.js --stop --port=<port>` instead of `taskkill`. It writes a stop file that dev.js watches, so the server cleans up and exits 0 and its terminal tab closes itself; a `taskkill /F` exits non-zero and leaves a dead "[process exited with code 1]" tab behind on every restart. `--stop` falls back to a force kill automatically if the server does not exit within 45s (e.g. an instance launched from a checkout predating the stop-file watcher). Omitting `--port` stops every preview this worktree is running.
- **Watching only observes.** It never stops or restarts the preview - do not run `/preview` again automatically just because a watcher fired.
- A notification arriving immediately after you ran `--stop` yourself is the expected confirmation of that stop, not a new event to alarm the user about.
- The watcher holds a background task slot for the preview's whole lifetime, which can be hours. It does NOT hold the board's activity indicator, as long as it carries `--kangentic-no-activity-hold` (see step 4). Pass `--no-watch` to skip the watcher entirely and launch fire-and-forget.
- If the Claude Code session restarts, a pending watch notification is lost. The preview is not killed BY the restart, but that is not the same as it still being up: once the watcher is gone you have no signal at all, so a later `--stop` (or a closed terminal) is invisible to you. Treat the state as unknown from that point on and re-verify before saying anything about it. Re-attach with `node scripts/worktree-preview.js --wait --port=<port> --kangentic-no-activity-hold` to restore the signal. This command is hand-typed rather than printed by the launcher, so carry the flag deliberately - omitting it re-pins the task ACTIVE for as long as the preview runs.

## Allowed Tools

Only use `Bash` (for the `node` command). Run from the current working directory - do not chain commands.
