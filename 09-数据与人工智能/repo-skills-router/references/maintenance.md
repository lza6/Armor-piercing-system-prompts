# Router maintenance

This router is generated from the fixed area -> family taxonomy and the v2 `references/repo-routing-metadata.json` fragment attached to each repository skill. The compact fragment contains only identity, taxonomy hash, status, and exact assignments. Full classification evidence belongs in the external production routing decision artifact, not in the runtime skill graph.

## Import contract

1. Finish and independently verify the generated repository skill.
2. Classify it against the exact taxonomy using repository evidence plus the generated skill as navigation context.
3. Write the external routing decision with assignment-specific rationale, evidence, and assignment-level confidence (`high`, `medium`, or `low`).
4. Write the minimal v2 metadata fragment only after the decision is made; confidence remains in the central assignment index and is not copied into runtime metadata.
5. Run the verified importer/updater under the shared lock so the skill, metadata, indexes, and router are updated together.

The central `repositories.jsonl` index preserves canonical repository identity, optional `legacy_repo_id`, source provenance, target skill root, aliases, and root description. It intentionally does not persist a per-repository-skill content digest because skills may be refreshed independently and the digest would add recurring maintenance without helping routing. The central `assignments.jsonl` index preserves canonical identity, optional `legacy_repo_id`, skill ID, exact area/family path, and confidence. These generated indexes are validated together with the per-skill metadata; unknown fields, duplicate identities, and mismatched assignments are errors. The complete repository and assignment index files remain protected by the overall digests in `build-metadata.json`. The one-time `skill_content_sha256` in an external import handoff may still be checked during import, but it is not copied into either long-lived repository index.

`unclassified` is valid only when no exact family is supported. Ask the user whether to import it; if they want it included, propose a taxonomy extension and wait for approval/correction before changing the canonical taxonomy. `blocked` and `failed` are processing outcomes and must not be imported as routable skills.
