# Repository Provenance

## Purpose

Read this before deciding whether this skill is current for a checkout of NVIDIA NeMo Speech. If the current repo commit, dirty state, package version, active collections, docs, examples, scripts, or public APIs differ from this snapshot, run `refresh-repo-skill` before relying on version-sensitive guidance.

## Refresh Check

- If `git rev-parse HEAD` differs from `repository.commit`, treat this skill as potentially stale and run `refresh-repo-skill`.
- If the current working tree has non-skill dirty paths that differ from the snapshot, run `refresh-repo-skill` before trusting API or workflow details.
- If `nemo-toolkit` package metadata, collection extras, install instructions, public model classes, example command signatures, or docs changed, refresh the skill.
- If the active NeMo repository has been split, renamed, or restored non-speech collections not covered here, refresh or extend the skill rather than assuming coverage.
