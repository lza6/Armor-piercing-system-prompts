# Open weights — pick the model, then clear the license

This is the CHOICE layer. Given a task, a box, and a shipping constraint, it tells you *which*
open model to reach for and *whether the license lets you ship it*. It does not download, run,
serve, or fine-tune anything — it feeds the skills that do (see [Related skills](#related-skills)).

## The one rule (read before you name a model)

**Model names and their licenses change monthly. Never state a license from memory — open the
model card and confirm it, every time.** This file was authored against cards live in mid-2026;
by the time you read it, versions have shipped and terms have moved. So:

- Treat every specific version/license line below as **[verify the card]**, not as settled fact.
- State the license **class** (OSI-open vs custom-community vs restricted), then send the reader to
  the actual `LICENSE` / terms page for the exact model + size they intend to ship.
- The *decision framework* and the *class taxonomy* are the durable parts. The version list is the
  perishable part. Weight your trust accordingly.

Real, verified-mid-2026 examples of *why* this rule exists — all confirmed against the source, and
all things that were different at my Jan-2026 cutoff:

- **Gemma 4** moved to **Apache-2.0**, while Gemma 1–3 stay on the custom Gemma Terms of Use
  (confirmed on [ai.google.dev/gemma/terms](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/terms), accessed
  2026-07-18). Same brand, opposite license class depending on version.
- **Codestral 2** was relicensed **Apache-2.0** (per Mistral, Apr 2026), while the original
  Codestral stays **non-production (MNPL)**. Same name, opposite shippability depending on release.
- **DeepSeek-R1** is **MIT**, but the original **DeepSeek-V3** weights ship under a **custom
  DeepSeek License Agreement with OpenRAIL-style use restrictions** (confirmed on the
  [V3 LICENSE-MODEL](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3/blob/main/LICENSE-MODEL)),
  not MIT. Same family, different license per model.

If three of the load-bearing facts moved in one release cycle, yours have too. Check the card.

## 1. How to choose an open model

Five gates, in this order. The license gate can veto everything above it, so never fall in love
with a model before you clear it.

1. **Task fit** — match the model's design to the job:
   - General chat / instruct → Llama, Qwen, Mistral, Gemma instruct variants.
   - Coding → Qwen-Coder, Codestral (license!), DeepSeek-Coder, gpt-oss.
   - Reasoning / math → DeepSeek-R1-style reasoning models, gpt-oss, Qwen reasoning variants.
   - Multilingual → Qwen and Gemma tend to lead; check the card's language list.
   - Multimodal (vision) → Llama vision, Qwen-VL, Gemma vision, PaliGemma, Phi multimodal.
   - Embeddings / retrieval → a dedicated embedding model, **not** a chat LLM → `embeddings-search`.
   - Small / edge → 0.5B–4B (Qwen small, Gemma small, Phi-mini, gpt-oss-20b class).
2. **Size vs your hardware class** — can it even fit? See [§4](#4-size--vram). A 70B at fp16 is
   ~140 GB; if you have one 24 GB GPU, that model is off the table unless you quantize *and* accept
   the quality/throughput cost. Pick a size your box can hold before you compare quality.
3. **License / shippability** — **the gate that matters most** (see [§3](#3-licenses)). Decide up
   front: is this a hobby/internal use, or a commercial product you distribute? "Open weights" does
   **not** mean "open source" and does **not** guarantee commercial rights. Verify the card.
4. **Hardware target** — consumer GPU (8–24 GB), data-center GPU (A100/H100 80 GB), Apple unified
   memory, or CPU/edge. This narrows both size and quant format (GGUF for CPU/Mac/llama.cpp; AWQ/GPTQ
   for GPU serving).
5. **Community support** — a proxy for "will this actually work Monday morning": are there
   ready-made GGUF/AWQ quants on the Hub, is it supported by your runtime (llama.cpp/Ollama/vLLM),
   are there fine-tunes and recent downloads? A model with no quants and no runtime support is a
   research artifact, not a shippable choice.

Rule of thumb: **smallest model that passes your eval wins.** Don't reach for 70B when a well-chosen
8B clears the bar — it's cheaper to run, faster, and fits more hardware. Prove it with `agent-eval`.

## 2. Model families

Families and *typical* size ladders below. Specific version claims are marked — **[verify]** at
author time; the family and its rough sizing are the durable part. Full per-family notes,
strengths, and license pointers in [references/model-families.md](references/model-families.md).

| Family | Maker | Typical open sizes | Notes / current line [verify] |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Llama** | Meta | ~1B–~400B (dense + MoE) | Llama 4 (Scout/Maverick, MoE) current line; custom **Community License**, gated |
| **Qwen** | Alibaba | 0.5B–235B+ (dense + MoE), strong Coder/VL | mostly Apache-2.0 but **per-size variance** — check each card |
| **Mistral / Mixtral** | Mistral AI | 7B dense, 8x7B/8x22B MoE, "Small/Large" | open ones Apache-2.0; **Codestral original = MNPL non-production** |
| **Gemma** | Google | ~1B–~27B, plus PaliGemma/CodeGemma/ShieldGemma | Gemma 1–3 = **custom Gemma Terms**; Gemma 4 = Apache-2.0 [verify] |
| **DeepSeek** | DeepSeek | V3-class MoE (~600B+), R1 reasoning, distills | **per-model license split** — R1 MIT, original V3 custom; verify |
| **Phi** | Microsoft | ~3B–15B ("mini", reasoning, multimodal) | **MIT** across the Phi-4 family [verify] |
| **gpt-oss** | OpenAI | 20B and 120B (MoE, open *weights*) | **Apache-2.0** [verify]; OpenAI's first open-weight LLMs since GPT-2 |
| Others | various | — | SmolLM, OLMo (fully-open incl. data), Falcon, Yi, Command — check card |

## 3. Licenses

**This is the load-bearing section. Get it wrong and you ship something you have no right to
ship.** Every model falls into one of three classes. Identify the class, then open the card.

### The three classes

| Class | Examples (class, not a promise) | What it means for shipping |
|---|---|---|
| **OSI-open** (Apache-2.0, MIT) | Qwen (most), Mistral open, Phi, gpt-oss, DeepSeek-R1, Gemma **4** | Commercial use, modify, redistribute — permissive. Still read the card for attribution/notice. |
| **Custom / community** | **Llama** (Meta Community), **Gemma 1–3** (Gemma Terms) | Broad free use **but with conditions**: acceptable-use policy, attribution, sometimes a scale cap. NOT OSI-open. |
| **Non-commercial / restricted** | original **Codestral** (MNPL), any "research-only", some RAIL, some "≥$X revenue → buy a license" | You **cannot** ship it in a commercial product without a separate license. Fatal if missed. |

"Open weights" describes availability of the weights file — it says nothing about your legal rights.
A model can be a free download and still be non-commercial. **The download button is not a license.**

### Per-family license notes (state the class, then verify the exact card)

- **Llama = Meta Llama Community License — NOT OSI-open.** Carries an Acceptable Use Policy, a
  **"Built with Llama"** attribution requirement on derivatives/products, naming rules, and a
  **>700M-monthly-active-users clause** (above that you must request a separate license from Meta,
  granted at Meta's discretion). Gated on the Hub (accept terms first). Verify the *current* Llama
  version's terms — Meta has revised them across releases.
- **Gemma = custom Gemma Terms of Use + Prohibited Use Policy** for Gemma 1–3 (not Apache), with a
  duty to pass the restrictions **downstream** to every user and to ship the terms/notice file.
  Gemma **4** reportedly moved to **Apache-2.0** — a textbook reason to check the version's card.
- **Qwen = mostly Apache-2.0, but with per-size variance.** Historically some sizes (often the very
  largest or a special tier) carried a separate Qwen license instead of Apache. **Check each size's
  card** — do not assume "Qwen = Apache" for the whole family.
- **Mistral / Mixtral open models = Apache-2.0**, but the **original Codestral is MNPL
  (non-production)** — free for research/eval, **not** for commercial deployment. Codestral **2**
  was relicensed Apache-2.0; verify which Codestral release you actually have. Note some newer
  Mistral models use a "Modified MIT" with a revenue-threshold commercial clause — verify.
- **DeepSeek = per-model split.** Code repos are MIT; **DeepSeek-R1 weights are MIT**; but the
  original **DeepSeek-V3 weights** ship under a **custom DeepSeek License Agreement with OpenRAIL-
  style use-based restrictions**. "DeepSeek = MIT" is too simple — verify the specific model.
- **Phi = MIT** across the Phi-4 family [verify] — genuinely permissive, commercial-friendly.
- **gpt-oss (OpenAI open-weight models, 20B/120B) = Apache-2.0** [verify] — permissive.

### Commercial-use checklist (run before you ship)

- [ ] Opened the **exact model + size** card and read its `LICENSE` / terms — not a blog, not this file.
- [ ] Confirmed the **class**: OSI-open, custom-community, or restricted/non-commercial.
- [ ] If custom/community: identified the **conditions** (attribution string, acceptable-use policy,
      MAU/revenue caps, downstream pass-through duty) and can meet them.
- [ ] If restricted: confirmed you are **not** deploying commercially, or obtained a separate license.
- [ ] Checked whether the model is **gated** (accept terms on the Hub before download).
- [ ] Checked the **base model** license — a fine-tune inherits the base's obligations (a Llama
      fine-tune still owes "Built with Llama"; a distill can inherit the teacher's terms).

Deeper class breakdown, gated-model mechanics, and the fine-tune-inheritance trap:
[references/licenses.md](references/licenses.md).

## 4. Size ↔ VRAM

A **selection-time** budget: will this size class even fit your hardware? (Operational per-request
KV-cache math lives in `ollama`/`vllm` — this is the "before I pick it" estimate.)

```text
weights_GB ≈ params(B) × bytes_per_param      # then add KV cache + runtime overhead on top
  fp16/bf16 → 2.0   (≈ 2 GB per 1B params)
  8-bit     → ~1.0  (≈ 1 GB per 1B params)
  4-bit     → ~0.6  (≈ 0.6 GB per 1B + cache + overhead; conservative ~0.5–0.6/param)
```

What that means per hardware class (weights only — leave headroom for context/KV cache):

| Hardware | fp16 ceiling | Practical pick (4-bit) |
|---|---|---|
| 8 GB consumer GPU | ~3B | 7–8B at 4-bit (~5 GB) |
| 16 GB | ~7B | 13–14B at 4-bit |
| 24 GB (e.g. 3090/4090) | ~10B | ~32B at 4-bit (~20 GB) |
| 80 GB (A100/H100) | ~34B | 70B at 4-bit (~40 GB), or a big-MoE like gpt-oss-120b |
| Apple unified (e.g. 64 GB) | shares with the OS | budget against **total** unified memory |
| multi-GPU / 2×80 GB+ | 70B fp16 (~140 GB) via tensor-parallel | full-precision large models |

**A 70B at fp16 is ~140 GB — it does not fit one GPU.** You either quantize (4-bit ≈ ~40 GB, fits one
80 GB card) or split across GPUs with **tensor parallelism** (that's a `vllm` job). Longer context
grows the KV cache *on top of* weights, so keep a margin. Full derivation + KV math:
[references/sizing-and-quant.md](references/sizing-and-quant.md).

## 5. Quant / formats

Quantization shrinks weights (fewer bits/param) to fit smaller hardware, trading a little quality.
Which **format** you pick is driven by your runtime:

| Format | Where it runs | Use it for |
|---|---|---|
| **GGUF** | llama.cpp, **Ollama**, LM Studio | CPU, Apple Silicon, single-box local; the everyday local format |
| **AWQ** | vLLM, TGI, transformers | GPU serving — activation-aware 4-bit, strong quality/latency |
| **GPTQ** | vLLM, TGI, transformers | GPU serving — older, widely available 4-bit |
| bitsandbytes (NF4) | transformers | quick load-time 4/8-bit for experiments/fine-tuning |
| EXL2 | ExLlamaV2 | flexible bit-rates on consumer GPUs |

**Decoding a GGUF quant tag like `Q4_K_M`:** `Q4` = ~4-bit weights; `_K` = a k-quant (mixed
precision — keeps the more sensitive tensors at higher bit-depth); `_M` = the medium size/quality
tier (`_S` smaller/lower, `_L` larger/higher). **`Q4_K_M` is the standard default** — roughly half
the memory of fp16 for a few percent quality loss. `Q8_0` is near-lossless (~1 byte/param); below
`Q4`, quality drops off fast. Don't go sub-Q4 to force a too-big model onto a too-small box — pick a
smaller model instead. More in [references/sizing-and-quant.md](references/sizing-and-quant.md).

## 6. Where to get it + how to run it (routing)

You've chosen a model and cleared its license. Now hand off — this skill stops here.

- **Get the weights / host on HF** → `huggingface` (Hub download/upload, Inference Providers,
  endpoints). Also where you convert to GGUF.
- **Run it locally on one box** (laptop/desktop, GGUF via Ollama) → `ollama`.
- **Serve it at throughput / with tensor-parallel** (production, batching, big models) → `vllm`.
- **Fine-tune it** (LoRA/QLoRA, SFT, preference tuning) → `finetuning`.
- **Prove the small model is enough** before committing → `agent-eval`.

The Hub filters (task + license + size + recent downloads) and the Ollama library are where you
actually find candidates — that mechanics lives in `huggingface` / `ollama`, not here.

## Guardrails / gotchas

- **Never assert a license from memory.** State the class, open the card. Licenses change per
  version, per size, and per release month.
- **"Open weights" ≠ "open source" ≠ "commercial-use OK".** Three different things.
- **A fine-tune inherits its base license.** Fine-tuning Llama does not launder away "Built with
  Llama" or the acceptable-use policy; a distill can inherit the teacher model's terms.
- **Gated ≠ restricted.** Gemma/Llama are gated (accept terms to download) yet usable commercially
  under their conditions; a "research-only" card is restricted regardless of gating.
- **Don't sub-Q4 a too-big model onto a too-small GPU.** Quality collapses and it still may OOM at
  real context. Choose a size that fits.
- **Newest ≠ best for you.** The smallest model that passes your eval wins on cost, speed, and fit.
- **MoE total vs active params.** A "120B" MoE may activate only ~5B/token (fast) but you still need
  VRAM for *all* experts — size against total params, not active.

## Related skills

- **`huggingface`** — get/host: Hub download/upload, Inference Providers, endpoints, GGUF
  conversion. This skill tells you *which* repo to pull; `huggingface` pulls it.
- **`ollama`** — run one model locally (GGUF, single box, VRAM sizing at request time). This skill
  says which model + quant *class* fits; `ollama` runs it and does the KV-cache math.
- **`vllm`** — serve at throughput, batching, tensor-parallel for models too big for one GPU.
- **`finetuning`** — adapt a chosen base with LoRA/QLoRA/SFT. Choose+clear the base here first.
- Boundary: this skill is **selection + licensing knowledge only**. It never re-teaches calling,
  running, serving, or training — it feeds those four.

## Checklist

- [ ] Named the **task** and matched a family designed for it (chat/code/reasoning/vision/embeddings/edge).
- [ ] Picked the **smallest size** likely to pass the eval, and confirmed it **fits the hardware class**.
- [ ] Identified the **license class** (OSI-open / custom-community / restricted).
- [ ] Opened the **exact model + size card** and confirmed the license — not from memory, not from a blog.
- [ ] For commercial use: met the conditions (attribution, acceptable-use, MAU/revenue caps) or confirmed permissive.
- [ ] Checked the **base model** license if it's a fine-tune/distill.
- [ ] Picked a **quant format** matching the runtime (GGUF local / AWQ-GPTQ serving) and a sane tier (`Q4_K_M` default).
- [ ] Handed off: `huggingface` (get), `ollama` (run local), `vllm` (serve), `finetuning` (adapt).
