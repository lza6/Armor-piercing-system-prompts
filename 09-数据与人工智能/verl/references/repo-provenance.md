# Repository Provenance

## Purpose

Read this before deciding whether this skill is current for a checkout of the repository. If the current repo commit, dirty state, package version, or major evidence paths differ from this snapshot, run `refresh-skill-from-repo`.

## Refresh Check

- If `git rev-parse HEAD` differs from `repository.commit`, treat the skill as potentially stale and run `refresh-skill-from-repo`.
- If the working tree dirty paths differ materially from `dirty_paths`, refresh before relying on source-specific claims.
- If package metadata, extras, training config files, rollout/tool APIs, examples, docs, or public test layouts changed, refresh even on the same commit.
- If backend support changed for vLLM, SGLang, Megatron, TensorRT-LLM, ROCm, or NPU stacks, refresh the setup, rollout, and training sub-skills together.
