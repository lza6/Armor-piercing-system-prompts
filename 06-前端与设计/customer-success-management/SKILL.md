name: customer-success-management
description: Runs the ongoing relationship with accounts after the sale — segmenting coverage against account value, building a health score that predicts rather than describes, running reviews customers find worth attending, forecasting renewals honestly, and finding expansion that follows usage instead of quota. Use this to design a customer success motion, decide who gets a named contact, work out why renewals surprise you, or fix a health score everyone ignores.

# Customer success management

This is the motion that keeps accounts, as distinct from diagnosing why they leave — for the
churn analysis itself, see `revenue:retention`. The failure this discipline exists to prevent is
finding out at renewal.

## Segment coverage before hiring anyone

Coverage is a cost decision and it should be made explicitly rather than by whoever shouts.

- **Named coverage** for accounts where the revenue justifies a person and the relationship is
  genuinely complex. Fewer accounts per person than instinct suggests — a manager with sixty
  accounts is running a queue, not a relationship.
- **Pooled coverage** for the middle: a team owning a segment, working from signals rather than
  from a calendar.
- **Programmatic coverage** for the long tail: in-product guidance, lifecycle messaging, and
  self-service. This is not a lesser tier, it is the only one that scales, and it usually deserves
  more investment than it gets.

Assign by what the account needs, not only by what it pays. A large account that is live, stable
and happy needs less than a small one mid-implementation.

## Build a health score that predicts something

Most health scores are a weighted average of whatever was available, colored red to green, and
trusted by nobody. A useful one is built backwards: take accounts that churned and accounts that
renewed, and find what actually differed six months out.

- **Usage depth and breadth** — how many people, how often, how many of the things they bought.
- **Trajectory over level.** An account at 60% of expected usage and rising is healthier than one
  at 90% and falling. Level tells you where they are; direction tells you where they are going.
- **Relationship coverage** — how many people you know, and whether your only contact is the person
  who bought.
- **Support and escalation history**, weighted by severity rather than volume.

**Validate it against outcomes and recalibrate.** A score that did not predict last year's churn
should not be steering this year's attention.

## The single-threaded account is the most common avoidable loss

When one person is your entire relationship, their departure is your renewal risk, and it arrives
with no warning. Track how many contacts each account has and treat single-threading as an
actionable condition rather than a fact of life.

## Make reviews worth the customer's hour

A business review that presents usage statistics back to the customer wastes both parties' time.
The ones people attend cover what they set out to achieve, where they actually are against it,
what is in the way, and what changes next — with the customer talking for at least half of it.

Frequency should follow value and risk, not a uniform quarterly cadence applied to everyone.

## Forecast renewals like a pipeline, because that is what it is

Renewal forecasting is more predictable than new business and is often done worse, because
everything is assumed to renew until it does not.

Start the renewal conversation far enough ahead that a problem is still fixable — for an annual
contract that is months, not weeks. Track renewals in stages with entry criteria, and separate
gross retention from net so expansion cannot mask a leak underneath it.

**Auto-renewal is a billing mechanism, not a relationship.** An account that auto-renewed while
disengaged is next year's churn with a delay.

## Expansion follows usage, not quota

The credible expansion conversation comes from something observable: they hit a limit, adopted the
thing that leads to the next thing, added a team. Expansion pushed on a quota calendar into an
account that has not realized its original purchase is how a renewal gets lost while chasing a
smaller number.

## Tooling

Customer success platforms: Gainsight, Totango, ChurnZero, Vitally, Planhat, and similar. They
earn their cost once you have more accounts than a person can hold in their head and product usage
data worth joining to the account record — before that, the CRM plus a usage query does the job.

Renewal and expansion tracking belongs in the CRM alongside new business, not in a separate system,
or the forecast will exist twice and disagree.

## Never

- Run a health score nobody has validated against actual outcomes.
- Let an account stay single-threaded without naming it as a risk.
- Open the renewal conversation inside the notice period.
- Report net retention without gross retention beside it.
