name: servo-control
description: Use to aim/point/look the device in a DIRECTION, toggle servo state (hold/resume/release), or play a named servo animation (nod/shake/etc). Directions are fixed named locations or axes — supported: desk, wall, left, right, up, down, center, user. Furniture and surfaces ("desk", "table", "floor", "ceiling", "wall", "door", "workspace") are ALWAYS directions, never tracking targets — map them to the closest of the supported names (table/workspace → desk). MUST use /servo/aim (not /servo/track) for: "look at the desk"→desk, "point at my table"→desk, "look at the wall"→wall, "look left"→left, "point up"→up, "look at me"→user. For following a movable OBJECT by vision (cup, phone, hand, person, pet) use servo-tracking instead. Compound: if user names a direction AND an object ("look at desk and follow cup"), fire THIS aim skill first, then tracking.

# Servo Control

## Quick Start
Controls the device's servo motors for directional aiming and physical animations. Use `/servo/aim` for directional pointing, `/servo/play` for expressive animations.

## Workflow
1. Determine if the user wants to **aim** the light or **play an animation**.
2. Prefix reply with the appropriate `[HW:...]` marker — the device fires it before TTS.
3. Confirm the action to the user.

**Important**: For conversation reactions, use the **Emotion** skill instead — it combines servo + LED + eyes automatically.

## Examples

**Input:** "Point the light at my desk"
**Output:** `[HW:/servo/aim:{"direction":"desk"}]` Done, aimed the light at your desk.

**Input:** "Look at the desk" / "Look at my table" / "Look at my workspace"
**Output:** `[HW:/servo/aim:{"direction":"desk"}]` Looking at the desk now.

**Input:** "Look at the wall"
**Output:** `[HW:/servo/aim:{"direction":"wall"}]` Looking at the wall.

**Input:** "Look at me"
**Output:** `[HW:/servo/aim:{"direction":"user"}]` Looking at you!

**Input:** "Look to the left"
**Output:** `[HW:/servo/aim:{"direction":"left"}]` Looking left now.

**Input:** "Aim at the wall slowly"
**Output:** `[HW:/servo/aim:{"direction":"wall","duration":3.0}]` Aiming at the wall slowly.

**Input:** "Nod for me"
**Output:** `[HW:/servo/play:{"recording":"nod"}]` Nodding!

**Input:** "Turn left 15 degrees"
**Output:** `[HW:/servo/nudge:{"yaw":-15}]` Turned a bit to the left.

**Input:** "Tilt up a little"
**Output:** `[HW:/servo/nudge:{"pitch":10}]` Tilted up slightly.

**Input:** "Release the motors"
**Output:** `[HW:/servo/release:{}]` Servos released — you can move the device by hand now.

**Input:** "Stop moving" / "Hold still" / "Freeze" / "Stand still"
**Output:** `[HW:/servo/hold:{}]` OK, holding still.

**Input:** "Turn to the right and hold that position"
**Output:** `[HW:/servo/aim:{"direction":"right"}][HW:/servo/hold:{}]` Turned right and holding.
→ Compound movement: emit **one marker per clause**, in order. They fire sequentially before TTS. Dropping the `hold` half means the device drifts back — never confirm a step you did not fire.

**Input:** "Turn right, hold it there, and tell me what you see"
**Output:** move FIRST with curl (so the camera sees the NEW view), then snapshot, then reply:
```bash
curl -sX POST http://127.0.0.1:5001/servo/aim -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"direction":"right"}'
curl -sX POST http://127.0.0.1:5001/servo/hold -d '{}'
curl -s "http://127.0.0.1:5001/camera/snapshot?save=true&width=768&quality=75"
```
→ Then describe the image. Do **not** use `[HW:...]` markers here — markers fire only *after* your reply is written, so a snapshot taken during the turn would show the OLD position. See the Camera skill.

**Input:** "Where are you?" / "Can you find me?" / "Look around for me" / "Where did I go?"
**Output:** `[HW:/servo/search:{}]` Looking around for you...

**Input:** "Find my cup" / "Look around for my keyboard" / "Where did I leave my phone?"
**Output:** `[HW:/servo/search:{"target":"cup"}]` Let me look around for it...
→ `target` is any noun — COCO classes are found locally, anything else via open-vocab.
   Without it the sweep looks for a PERSON and will end on the first one it sees,
   which is why an object search must always name its target.

**Input:** "Scan the whole room" / "Show me your maximum capability in scanning" / "Do a full scan"
**Output:** `[HW:/servo/search:{"exhaustive":true}]` Doing a full sweep — this takes a moment...
→ Walks the whole look ring at every bearing instead of returning at the first sighting.
   Combine with `target` when they ask for a thorough search for a specific thing.

**Input:** "I moved you" / "You're in a new place" / "I put you somewhere else" / "Forget where I sit"
**Output:** `[HW:/servo/bearing/reset:{}]` Got it — I'll forget where you usually are and learn it again.

**Input:** "Resume" / "Move again" / "You can move now" / "Start moving"
**Output:** `[HW:/servo/resume:{}]` Alright, back to normal!

## How to Control Servo

**No exec/curl needed.** Inline markers at start of reply:

```
[HW:/servo/aim:{"direction":"desk"}] Aimed at your desk.
[HW:/servo/aim:{"direction":"left","duration":3.0}] Aiming left slowly.
[HW:/servo/play:{"recording":"nod"}] Nodding!
[HW:/servo/hold:{}] OK, holding still.
[HW:/servo/resume:{}] Back to normal!
[HW:/servo/release:{}] Servos released.
```

`duration` on `/servo/aim` controls move speed in seconds (default 2.0, 0 = instant).

### Nudge by degrees (relative movement)

```
[HW:/servo/nudge:{"yaw":-15}] Turned left 15 degrees.
[HW:/servo/nudge:{"pitch":10}] Tilted up a bit.
[HW:/servo/nudge:{"yaw":30,"pitch":-5,"duration":1.5}] Moved right and down.
```

| Parameter | Range | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `yaw` | -180 to 180 | Negative = left, positive = right |
| `pitch` | -90 to 90 | Negative = down, positive = up |
| `duration` | 0 to 10 | Move speed in seconds (default 2.0) |

### Available directions

| Direction | What it does |
|---|---|
| `center` | Neutral position, straight ahead |
| `desk` | Tilts down toward the desk surface |
| `wall` | Tilts up toward the wall behind |
| `left` | Turns left |
| `right` | Turns right |
| `up` | Points upward |
| `down` | Points downward |
| `user` | Slightly toward the user (default interaction pose) |

### Play animation

Available animations:

| Animation | When to use |
|---|---|
| `curious` | Something interesting, questions |
| `nod` | Agreement, acknowledgment |
| `headshake` | Disagreement, saying no |
| `happy_wiggle` | Joy, good news |
| `idle` | Resting state |
| `sad` | Empathy, bad news |
| `excited` | High energy, celebrations |
| `shy` | Bashful moments |
| `shock` | Surprise |
| `scanning` | Looking around, searching |
| `wake_up` | Waking up, starting a new session |
| `music_groove` | Grooving to music (auto-triggered during playback) |
| `music_chill` | Chill/lo-fi vibe (auto-triggered during calm music) |
| `music_hype` | High-energy hype (auto-triggered during EDM/party music) |
| `listening` | Attentive lean forward, user is speaking |
| `thinking_deep` | Slow deliberate look side-to-side, processing |
| `laugh` | Quick body shake, something funny |
| `confused` | Dog-like head tilt, did not understand |
| `sleepy` | Slow droop with catches, winding down |
| `greeting` | Wave gesture, saying hello |
| `goodbye` | Farewell wave, seeing someone off |
| `acknowledge` | Quick micro-nod (1.5s), confirming |
| `stretching` | Big extension + settle, after waking up |

### Hold position (stop moving)

```
[HW:/servo/hold:{}] OK, holding still.
```

Suppresses idle and ambient animations — the device freezes in current pose. Emotions still play through (the device reacts when you talk, then holds still again). Call `/servo/resume` to return to normal.

**Triggers:** "stop moving", "hold still", "freeze", "don't move", "stand still"

### Resume from hold

```
[HW:/servo/resume:{}] Back to normal!
```

Exits hold mode and resumes idle animations.

**Triggers:** "resume", "move again", "you can move now", "start moving"

### Release servos (disable motors)

```
[HW:/servo/release:{}] Servos released.
```

Disables all servo motors so they can be moved freely by hand.

## Error Handling
- If the API returns an error or is unreachable, inform the user that servo control is temporarily unavailable.
- If an invalid direction is given, fall back to the closest matching direction from the available set.
- If an unknown animation is requested, list the available animations for the user.

## Rules
- **For conversation reactions, use the Emotion skill** — it calls servo automatically. Do not use this skill for emotional responses.
- Animations play once and return to rest position.
- Aim positions are persistent until changed.
- Use `/servo/aim` as the primary way to control light direction — do not use raw joint control unless testing.
- Always confirm the action to the user after execution.
- **Hold vs Release**: Hold keeps torque ON (the device stays rigid in place). Release turns torque OFF (the device goes limp). Use hold for "stop moving", release for "let me reposition the device by hand".
- **Hold is soft** — emotions still animate through, then the device holds still again. This keeps the device feeling alive during conversation while respecting the user's request to stop fidgeting.

## Output Template

```
[Servo] {action} — {direction_or_animation}
