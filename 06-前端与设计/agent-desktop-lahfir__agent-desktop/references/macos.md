# macOS Platform

macOS-specific details for agent-desktop. Covers permissions, accessibility API behavior, troubleshooting, and platform quirks.

## Prerequisites

### Permission Report (TCC)

macOS requires explicit Accessibility permission for any process that reads or controls UI elements across applications.

```bash
# Check permission status
agent-desktop permissions

# Trigger the system dialog
agent-desktop permissions --request
```

The report contains:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `accessibility` | Required for accessibility tree reads and most commands |
| `screen_recording` | Required for screenshots |
| `automation` | Apple Event Automation permission for System Events; plain `permissions` checks without prompting, `permissions --request` may prompt in the bounded isolated helper |

Each field is an object: `{ "state": "granted" }`, `{ "state": "denied", "suggestion": "..." }`, `{ "state": "not_required" }`, or `{ "state": "unknown" }`. The current macOS adapter reports concrete `granted` or `denied` states for Accessibility and Screen Recording. Automation may report `unknown` when macOS would need to prompt or System Events could not be probed.

**To grant manually:**
1. Open System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility
2. Click the lock to make changes
3. Add the app that launches agent-desktop (Terminal.app, iTerm2, Warp, VS Code, Codex, etc.)
4. Toggle it ON

**Important:** The permission is granted to the launching app. If macOS lists the built `agent-desktop` binary separately, grant that binary too. If you run agent-desktop from a different launcher, grant that launcher as well.

After granting, restart the terminal for the permission to take effect.

### Supported macOS Versions

- macOS 12 (Monterey) and later
- Both Intel (x86_64) and Apple Silicon (ARM64)

## macOS Accessibility API (AX)

agent-desktop uses the macOS Accessibility API (`AXUIElement`) to read and manipulate UI elements.

### How It Works

1. `AXUIElementCreateApplication(pid)` creates a handle to an app's accessibility tree
2. Tree traversal reads `kAXChildrenAttribute` recursively
3. Attributes like `kAXRoleAttribute`, `kAXNameAttribute`, `kAXValueAttribute` provide element details
4. Actions like `kAXPressAction`, `kAXConfirmAction` trigger element behavior

### Action Chains

Core resolves and validates a ref, applies its headed focus/cursor requirement, and then asks the macOS adapter to execute an action-specific chain. The chain records each attempted mechanism and never invents a generic fallback ladder:

- Headless `click` performs whichever activation the element publishes — `AXPress`, `AXOpen`, or `AXConfirm` — and falls back to writing the owning container's selection (`AXSelected`, `AXSelectedRows`, or `AXSelectedChildren`) for rows that publish no activation action. Only advertised actions are performed, because a responder can answer success to an action it never published. Headed `click` uses a verified-point `CGClick` first, then the same semantic chain if physical delivery was not attempted.
- Return codes do not decide delivery. Finder answers `kAXErrorAttributeUnsupported` from an `AXOpen` that navigates and `kAXErrorSuccess` from an `AXConfirm` that does nothing, so a performed action is judged by observing the application.
- Headed `right-click` uses physical right-click first; headless uses the bounded `AXShowMenu` family.
- Headed `type`, `clear`, and `scroll` use PID-targeted keyboard, keyboard clear, and wheel delivery respectively; their headless paths use AX semantics.
- `expand` and `collapse` use a verified semantic disclosure mutation in both modes.
- `set-value`, `select`, toggle/check/uncheck, focus, and `scroll-to` are semantic-only.
- Double/triple-click, hover, and drag are physical gestures and require headed mode.

For `right-click`, `AXShowMenu` may enter modal menu tracking and return `kAXErrorCannotComplete` after the menu opened. The command reports this as `APP_UNRESPONSIVE` with `delivery: delivery_uncertain` and `retry: unsafe`; inspect the resulting menu or target effect instead of retrying blindly. Combo boxes and menu buttons use the same AX menu mechanism for their primary dropdown; use `select` for those controls. Coordinate right-click is blocked by the default headless policy.

Menu verification for `select` intentionally requires a closed-to-open transition. If a menu is already open for the target app, dismiss it before selecting so an existing sibling menu is not treated as proof of success.

The default activation-chain deadline is 10 seconds. Set `AGENT_DESKTOP_CHAIN_TIMEOUT_MS` to a positive millisecond value when diagnosing unusually slow AX targets; values are capped at 300000 ms. Menu verification waits use `AGENT_DESKTOP_MENU_TIMEOUT_MS` with a default of 750 ms and a 10000 ms cap. Toggle verification uses `AGENT_DESKTOP_TOGGLE_TIMEOUT_MS` with a default of 600 ms and a 10000 ms cap; changed toggle values must remain stable for `AGENT_DESKTOP_TOGGLE_STABLE_MS`, default 200 ms and cap 2000 ms.

### Headless Interaction Policy

Ref commands use `ActionRequest { action, policy }`. The default policy forbids focus stealing, cursor movement, keyboard synthesis, and pasteboard insertion. Core maps headed actions to `FocusedWindow` or `FocusedWindowAndCursor`, focuses the exact ref window, and resolves pointer coordinates before calling macOS. The adapter owns AppKit/AX/CGEvent delivery:

- `click`, `right-click`, `type`, `clear`, and `scroll` use semantic AX delivery headlessly and physical-first delivery with `--headed`.
- `expand`, `collapse`, `set-value`, `select`, `toggle`, `check`, `uncheck`, `focus`, and `scroll-to` remain semantic under `--headed` after any core focus precondition.
- `press`, `hover`, `drag`, `mouse-move`, `mouse-click`, and `mouse-wheel` are explicit physical input; cursor-moving commands require `--headed`.
- Raw coordinates never trigger focus because they carry no window identity. Held-input commands are reserved and fail closed until a daemon owns their lifetime.
- FFI ref-action callers get the same strict headless `type` default; direct-handle `ad_execute_action` is lower-level and applies the supplied policy verbatim.
- If a command would need a forbidden physical path, it returns a structured error with a recovery hint.

### Surfaces

macOS apps can have multiple accessibility surfaces:

| Surface | Description | When to use |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| `window` | Main application window (default) | General UI interaction |
| `focused` | Currently focused element's context | Inspecting active element |
| `menu` | Open dropdown or context menu | After `select`, `right-click`, or an explicit menu trigger |
| `menubar` | Application menu bar | Navigating File/Edit/View menus |
| `sheet` | Modal sheet (Save dialog, etc.) | After triggering sheet dialogs |
| `popover` | Popover/popup content | Inspecting tooltips, popovers |
| `alert` | System or app alert | Handling alert dialogs |

```bash
# List available surfaces
agent-desktop list-surfaces --app "Finder"

# Snapshot a specific surface
agent-desktop snapshot --app "Finder" --surface menu -i
```

### Surface-First Snapshot Rule

**When a snapshot shows a sheet, alert, popover, or menu is open, ALWAYS re-snapshot with the matching `--surface` flag.** The full app tree includes refs for the entire window behind the overlay — those refs are irrelevant and waste tokens. The surface snapshot returns only the overlay's refs, which are the only ones you can meaningfully interact with.

| Snapshot shows... | Next command |
|-------------------|-------------|
| A sheet is open (Save, Export, Print dialog) | `snapshot --app "App" --surface sheet -i` |
| An alert is visible (confirmation, error) | `snapshot --app "App" --surface alert -i` |
| A menu is open (dropdown, context menu) | `snapshot --app "App" --surface menu -i` |
| A popover appeared (tooltip, picker) | `snapshot --app "App" --surface popover -i` |

**Do not interact with refs from the full window snapshot while an overlay is open.** The overlay captures focus — clicks on background refs will either fail or dismiss the overlay unexpectedly. Snapshot the surface, interact with it, then snapshot the window again after the overlay closes.

## Notification Center

agent-desktop interacts with macOS Notification Center via the accessibility API.

### How It Works

1. **NcSession** reuses an already-open Notification Center headlessly, or opens it only when headed policy allows focus/cursor side effects
2. Notifications are read from the AX tree under the NotificationCenter process
3. When NcSession opened the center, it closes it and restores the previously focused app afterward
4. The `Drop` impl ensures cleanup even on errors

All notification mutations require `--headed`. Listing and notification waits can remain headless only when Notification Center is already open.

### Dismiss Strategy

Mutation chain under explicit headed policy:

1. **AXDismiss** / **AXRemoveFromParent** — native accessibility actions
2. **Close button** — find and press AXButton named "close", "clear", or "dismiss"
3. **Hover + close button** — use the authorized pointer path to reveal a hidden close button, then press it
4. If all fail, returns `ACTION_FAILED`

**Important:** `AXPress` is intentionally excluded from dismiss — it "clicks" the notification body (opening the source app) without actually dismissing it.

### Stacked Notifications

macOS groups notifications from the same app into stacks. Dismissing the top notification may reveal more underneath. `dismiss-all-notifications` iterates in reverse order but may need multiple rounds for deeply stacked groups.

### Notification Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Script Editor opens during dismiss | Notification owned by osascript | Fixed — NcSession restores previous app focus |
| `dismiss-notification` reports success but notification stays | AXPress was firing instead of AXDismiss | Fixed — AXPress removed from dismiss chain |
| Calendar widget can't be dismissed | It's a system widget, not a notification | Expected behavior — not a real notification |
| Notifications disappear before listing | Banner-style notifications are transient | Use `wait --notification` to detect them |

## Troubleshooting

### PERM_DENIED

```
"code": "PERM_DENIED",
"message": "Accessibility permission not granted"
```

**Fix:**
1. `agent-desktop permissions --request` to trigger dialog
2. System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility
3. Add and enable your terminal
4. Restart terminal

### Empty or Sparse Tree

Some apps don't expose full accessibility trees:
- **Electron apps** (VS Code, Slack): Generally good accessibility support
- **Custom-rendered UIs** (games, some creative tools): May have no accessibility tree
- **Web views**: Content inside WebViews may be limited

**Try:**
- Remove `-i` flag to see all elements including non-interactive ones
- Increase `--max-depth` to explore deeper
- Use `screenshot` as a visual fallback
- For a Chromium-based app's web contents specifically, `launch --cdp` plus a CDP client is a faster path than a deep accessibility walk — see `references/commands-system.md`. Accessibility remains the only attach story for an app already running, and the only path to native surfaces even when `--cdp` is in use.

### STALE_REF / SNAPSHOT_NOT_FOUND

```
"code": "STALE_REF",
"message": "Element not found: role=..., name=..."
```

The UI changed between your snapshot and action, or the element could not be re-identified. Run `snapshot` again and use the new refs. If the requested `snapshot_id` does not exist, the command returns `SNAPSHOT_NOT_FOUND`.

### POLICY_DENIED

```
"code": "POLICY_DENIED"
```

The semantic AX path could not complete and a physical/headed path was blocked by policy. Use `--headed` only when physical interaction is intended, for example `agent-desktop --headed hover @ref`, `agent-desktop --headed drag ...`, or `agent-desktop --headed mouse-click --xy x,y`.

### ACTION_FAILED

```
"code": "ACTION_FAILED"
```

The accessibility action was rejected. This can happen when:
- The element is disabled
- The app is busy or unresponsive
- The element doesn't support the requested action

**Try:**
1. Check `is @ref --property enabled` first
2. If physical interaction is intended, get bounds with `get @ref --property bounds`, then use `agent-desktop --headed mouse-click --xy x,y`
3. Use keyboard explicitly: `focus @ref` then `press return`

### APP_NOT_FOUND

The application isn't running. Launch it first:
```bash
agent-desktop launch "App Name"
```

### Slow Snapshots

Large apps (Xcode, Safari with many tabs) can have deep trees.

**Optimize:**
- Use `-i` to filter to interactive elements only
- Use `--max-depth 5` to limit depth
- Use `--compact` to remove empty structural nodes
- Use `--skeleton` for dense apps, then `snapshot --root @ref --snapshot <snapshot_id>` to drill down
- Target a specific window with `--window-id`
- Use `find` instead of full snapshot when you know what you're looking for

### Context Menu Doesn't Appear

After `right-click @ref`, inspect the open menu or the target effect. If macOS returns `APP_UNRESPONSIVE` for `AXShowMenu` with unsafe retry semantics:
1. The element may not support context menus
2. If the target is a combo box or menu button, use `select @ref "Option"` instead
3. Run `list-surfaces --app "App"` to confirm whether a menu surface exists
4. If physical interaction is intended, try `agent-desktop --headed mouse-click --xy x,y --button right` with coordinates from `get @ref --property bounds`

## macOS-Specific Behavior

### Agent cursor overlay

macOS keeps one click-through AppKit child per enabled session, with separate borderless windows for the cursor, the card, the ripple, and the element outline.

- The cursor is a filled dart with a contrasting rim, drawn from the session style.
- Effect windows sit one level below the cursor window, so the cursor always stays on top.
- The child acknowledges arrival over its session socket; the action dispatches only after that.
- The element outline and the card animate on Core Animation, so neither blocks the render loop.
- Reduce Motion is honoured. The overlay never activates an app, moves the OS pointer, or changes command delivery, and it fails soft if its child cannot start.

### App Identification

Apps can be referenced by:
- **Display name:** `"System Settings"`, `"Finder"`, `"TextEdit"`
- **Bundle ID:** `"com.apple.systempreferences"`, `"com.apple.finder"`

`launch` accepts both. Other commands use the display name with `--app`.

### Window IDs

Window IDs (like `w-4521`) are assigned by macOS and are stable for the lifetime of the window. Use `list-windows` to discover them.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

macOS uses `cmd` (Command) as the primary modifier:
```bash
agent-desktop press cmd+c   # Copy
agent-desktop press cmd+v   # Paste
agent-desktop press cmd+z   # Undo
agent-desktop press cmd+s   # Save
agent-desktop press cmd+w   # Close window
agent-desktop press cmd+q   # Quit app (use with caution!)
```

### Full-Screen Apps

Apps in full-screen mode are accessible but may behave differently:
- `list-windows` still shows them
- Bounds may report full screen dimensions
- Some animations may delay UI state updates (use `wait`)

### Menu Bar Apps

Menu bar apps (status bar items) can be accessed via `--surface menubar`. The menu bar is a separate surface from the application window.
