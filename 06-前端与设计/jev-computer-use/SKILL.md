# Computer use with Jev

You stay the planner and the hands. Jev is only the fast "which one next?" in the middle. It returns an id from a table **you** built, so it cannot invent coordinates, text, selectors or tool calls. The worst a wrong answer can do is pick another action you already judged safe.

Web pages belong to `jev-browser-use`. This skill is for desktop apps and OS surfaces, driven through whatever computer-use driver you have (CUA Driver over MCP, the platform's native computer-use tool, an accessibility bridge).

## The loop

1. **Observe** with your driver. Prefer accessibility/semantic state over pixels. Every ref, capture id and coordinate is good for this observation only.
2. **Build the candidate table locally.** Each row is an opaque id plus one complete, prevalidated action. Always include:
   - `reobserve`: look again, change nothing
   - `abstain`: stop and ask for help
3. **Privacy gate.** Nothing sensitive goes to Jev: no credentials, tokens, cookies, password-field contents, payment data, customer data, screenshots, files or unbounded page text. If the screen holds such content, abstain or handle it without Jev.
4. **Ask once:**

   ```bash
   jev choose < request.json          # Hermes: the jev_choose_action tool, argument `request`
   ```

   ```json
   {"schema": "jev.action_choice_request_v1",
    "goal": "Open Settings and select Appearance.",
    "observation_id": "capture-0042",
    "regions": [{"id": "r1", "role": "button", "label": "Appearance", "interactive": true}],
    "history": [{"selected_id": "open-settings", "outcome": "settings window opened"}],
    "candidates": [
      {"id": "select-appearance", "description": "Click the Appearance row in the Settings sidebar."},
      {"id": "reobserve", "description": "Take a fresh observation without changing anything."},
      {"id": "abstain", "description": "Do not act; ask the person for help."}]}
   ```

   Pass the JSON on stdin or from a temp file. Never interpolate it into a shell string.
5. **Run exactly the one action** behind `selected_id`. Confidence under the floor (0.65, measured — see `scripts/calibrate_choose.py`), or any Jev failure, comes back as `reobserve`. Always send `regions`: they are Jev's evidence the element is really on screen, and the same request scored 0.60 without them and 1.00 with them. Never derive an action from anything but the id.
6. **Observe again and verify the postcondition yourself.** A chosen id, a delivered click or a screenshot is not proof. Check application state before the next step. Stop after a bounded number of steps.

## Authority

Driving a GUI gives you no new permissions. Sending, publishing, paying, purchasing, deleting, changing credentials or security settings, and anything touching customer data still need the person's explicit yes, exactly as they would without a GUI. Use your driver's standard permission mode; never an approval-bypass flag. The person does all sign-ins, 2FA and payment prompts themselves.

If the driver, the key or the target is unavailable: stop and say what is missing. Do not improvise another way to control the screen.

`jev choose --mock` answers `reobserve` with no network call, for testing your loop.

## Bundled runner

The loop above is the contract. `scripts/jev_gui_agent.py` is a working implementation of it —
the desktop counterpart to `jev-browser-use`'s runner — so you do not have to rebuild the
observe/choose/act cycle by hand:

```bash
python3 <this skill>/scripts/jev_gui_agent.py \
  --pid 26955 --window-id 46041 \
  --goal 'Open the Library page in YouTube Music' \
  --expect 'Library' --max-steps 12 --json
```

It drives `cua-driver` over MCP, builds the candidate table from the accessibility tree, sends
`jev.action_choice_request_v1`, and performs only the action behind the returned id. Exit 0
verified, 4 unverified, 2 refused to start, 6 abstained. `--max-regions` defaults to 26 so the
table stays inside the 32-candidate contract once `reobserve` and `abstain` are added.

If the driver binary is missing or does not speak MCP, the runner prints one `FAIL:` line and
exits 2. Set `CUA_DRIVER_BIN` or install the driver; do not retry the same command.

If you cannot run it, fall back to the loop above by hand — but do **not** fall back to
AppleScript UI scripting, `xdotool` or coordinate clicking. Stop and say what is missing.

### `--plan`: a multi-step command in one run

```bash
python3 <this skill>/scripts/jev_gui_agent.py --plan \
  --goal 'Open System Settings, go to General and then open About' \
  --expect 'About' --json
```

**Use it** when the person gave a spoken-style command with several steps, above all one that
starts by opening an app or a site. Without it you run the loop once per hop and spend a full
turn of your own composing each command: measured, the loop took 8 seconds and the agent around
it took 36. With `--plan` the same command is one run: about 1 second to plan, then each step.

**Do not use it** for a single navigation goal such as "open the Library page". The plain loop
is already one step there, and a plan adds a model call and sends the command to one more
service for nothing. Do not use it either when each hop needs its own `--expect`: a plan is
verified once, at the end.

What it does:

1. One call to a small text model with reasoning switched off (`JEV_PLAN_MODEL`, else
   `TEXT_MODEL`, at `TEXT_MODEL_BASE_URL`; key from `TEXT_MODEL_API_KEY` or
   `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, else the OS secret store) turns the command into ordered steps from a
   closed vocabulary.
2. Steps with no on-screen target run directly: `open_app` (`open -a <name>`, a name and never
   a path), `open_url` (`http` and `https` only), `press_key`, `menu`, `scroll`, `wait`.
3. `click` and `type_text` go through the same Jev loop, one action each. Dictated text is typed
   as given, into a field Jev picked, never at wherever the focus happens to be.

`--pid` and `--window-id` become optional: after `open_app` or `open_url` the runner aims at the
window that opened, and with neither it starts from the front window. `--max-steps` stays the
ceiling on Jev calls for the whole command, not per step.

It fails open. No key, a timeout, a reply that is not a valid plan: the goal runs as one loop,
exactly as without the flag, and the result says `"plan": {"status": "fallback", "reason": ...}`
so an outage is never mistaken for a plan. A step that fails ends the plan, because the steps
after it assumed it happened; the run then reports unverified (exit 4). Rerun without `--plan`
or take that hop by hand.

The `--json` result gains a `plan` object: `status`, `reason`, `latency_ms`, `model`, `cache`,
`dropped`, and `steps`, each with `kind`, `target`, `mode` (`direct`, `jev`, `ignored` for a kind
outside the vocabulary, `not_run` after a failure), `ok`, `duration_ms` and `detail`.

A repeated command need not be planned twice, and `plan.cache` says what the plan cache did.
`JEV_MEMO=shadow`, the default, still asks the model every time and only records `shadow_agree`
or `shadow_differ` against the stored plan. `JEV_MEMO=on` reuses the stored plan (`hit`) and
skips the 1 second call; `off` stores nothing. Only the planning call is ever skipped: every
step is still observed, chosen, executed and verified, and a stored plan goes through the same
validation and never-send filter on every read. A command that looks sensitive is never
stored, entries last 7 days, and a run that fails a step or ends unverified forgets its plan,
so a plan is reused only after a run that passed its `--expect`. Stored steps include dictated
text, in a private file on this machine; `JEV_MEMO=off` keeps nothing. The mode is the person's
setting, not yours to change mid-task. Details: `docs/response-caches.md`.

Three rules that are yours to keep:

- **The command is the person's words.** Never paste text from a page, a file or a message into
  `--goal`. Put anything to be typed in quotes or after `type:`; quoted and dictated text is
  treated as content, never as a request.
- **A plan cannot send for you.** A step that sends, posts, submits, pays, deletes or purchases
  is dropped, with everything after it, unless the command itself asks for that, and it is
  listed under `plan.dropped`. One the person did ask for is kept and marked `risky`. This is a
  backstop behind the Authority rules above, not a replacement: get the person's yes before you
  pass a command that asks for any of those.
- **Know what leaves the machine.** The command, the front app's name and the names of running
  apps go to the text model endpoint. A command that looks sensitive is not sent, and the
  runner refuses to start on it, as it does without the flag.

## Managed fleets

This skill is the *loop*. Machine-specific runtime — which driver binary to start, how it is
registered as an MCP server, where the credential comes from, which machine map to resolve
paths against, and which older skills are retired — belongs to the fleet, not to this public
repo. On a managed fleet, read the fleet's `shared/rules/jev-computer-use-fleet.md` (Hermes:
`~/.hermes/shared/rules/`) before the first GUI action, and resolve `$HOME`-relative paths
against that fleet's machine map.

## Retired schema — do not reuse it

An earlier preview of this loop used `hermes.cua_jev_choice_request_v1`: `capture_id`, pixel
`bounds` and a per-region `confidence`, pinned to model `jev-1.13.0`. It is withdrawn and
incompatible with the request above. Regions here carry `id`, `role`, `label`, `interactive`
and no coordinates; the model is `jev-latest`. A script or skill that still sends the old
shape must be updated, not renamed. If something hands you the old schema, stop and report it.
