# Governed Implementation

Deliver `$ARGUMENTS` under the repository's governance model. Use this skill for
substantive implementation; use `quick` for trivial non-behavioral changes and
`spec` when no implementation is required.

## Operational Baseline

### Discovery

Establish current state before choosing a workflow:

```bash
govctl status
govctl work list active
govctl work list queue
govctl loop list open
govctl search <topic>
```

Read a matching Work Item with `govctl work show <WI-ID>` and inspect relevant
RFCs or ADRs through their `show` commands. Use `govctl <resource> --help` for
current syntax and diagnostics for recovery. In the govctl repository itself,
invoke the development binary as `cargo run --quiet --`.

### Hard Stops

- RFCs are authoritative. Stop when the requested behavior conflicts with a
  normative RFC or is materially unspecified.
- Do not implement behavior that depends on a draft RFC.
- Obtain user authorization before lifecycle-owned or destructive artifact
  operations, including acceptance/rejection, phase or version changes,
  deprecation, supersession, and deletion, unless the request already grants it.
- Do not edit files under `gov/` directly; use canonical govctl resource
  commands. Clause operations use the root `govctl clause` namespace.
- Substantive implementation needs a matching active Work Item. Do not create
  separate Work Items for mechanical substeps.
- Stop before mutation when authoritative lifecycle state or the required
  recovery path cannot be established.

## Decision Policy

### Choose The Smallest Governance Path

| Situation                                               | Action                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Existing normative RFC fully specifies the change       | Implement against it                                                                |
| Behavior is new, ambiguous, deprecated, or incompatible | Establish the obligation in an RFC; use an ADR only for supporting design rationale |
| Change is trivial and non-behavioral                    | Hand off to `quick`                                                                 |
| Work is governance-only                                 | Hand off to `spec`                                                                  |

Use one Work Item for one durable outcome. Reuse a matching active item, activate
a queued item, or create one only when the result deserves durable tracking.
Use `wi-writer` for field quality and choose the narrowest guards that cover the
changed risk. Project defaults are for checks required by every Work Item.

Use a loop when non-trivial execution needs local round evidence. Let govctl
generate the loop ID, reuse an open matching loop, and keep transient progress in
loop state rather than Work Item notes.

### Preserve Artifact Authority

- RFC: obligations and externally relevant invariants.
- ADR: design choice, rationale, and consequences.
- Work Item: task scope, acceptance criteria, dependencies, and durable
  execution facts.
- Conformance Case: a derived, non-normative mapping from a project scenario to
  versioned RFC Clauses and reusable Guards.

Work Item `description` states scope and reason. `notes` hold only facts or retry
constraints that remain useful after closure. Progress, validation output,
plans, and temporary blockers belong in loop evidence or the final response.
Use `govctl conformance trace` for requirement-to-scenario navigation. Never
treat a Case as authority for behavior that is absent from its RFC requirements.

### Respect RFC Lifecycle Boundaries

Inspect the current RFC with `show` and read its governing lifecycle clauses
before mutation. Do not implement against draft or deprecated content, progress
an amended sealed version without its authorized bump, or mutate a post-`spec`
RFC whose sealed baseline cannot be established. Clause `since` is
lifecycle-owned; use canonical Clause lifecycle commands rather than editing
history.

### Implement And Verify

Keep implementation scoped to the Work Item and governing artifacts. When work
reveals a specification defect, repair the specification through the authorized
lifecycle rather than silently deviating.

When source reference scanning is enabled, express its positive domain in
`source_scan.include`. Project `.gitignore` files provide baseline exclusions;
put governance-specific exclusions and re-inclusions in `.govignore`. A custom
`source_scan.pattern` uses capture group 1 as the artifact ID for every match.

Run the narrowest useful checks while developing. Before closing the Work Item,
do not manually repeat guards that `govctl work move <WI-ID> done` is about to
run. Standalone verification is for diagnosis or evidence while the item remains
active. Use the `compliance-checker` agent, not an artifact reviewer, when
RFC-governed implementation behavior changes materially.

Recover from diagnostics by changing the failing assumption or approach. Do not
repeat the same failed command without new evidence.

## Completion Evidence

The task is complete when:

- implementation matches the governing RFCs and accepted ADRs;
- `govctl check` passes for the governed repository;
- relevant focused tests and generated projections are current;
- semantic review has no unresolved critical finding;
- Work Item acceptance criteria reflect the delivered outcome;
- moving the Work Item to `done` passes its effective guards; and
- the final response reports the result, validation, and any residual risk.

Use the `commit` skill for raw VCS operations.
