# Pull Request

Commit, rebase, create a pull request, and drive its CI checks to all-green. This is the **Testing
column** skill: it offloads the expensive and flaky test tiers (unit, UI, and the Windows Electron
E2E tier) to GitHub Actions PR checks instead of running them on the local machine, then auto-fixes
any failures and de-flakes any flaky tests until the PR is green and flake-free.

It **never merges**. When the PR is green, the user manually moves the task Testing -> Merge, where
`/merge-pull-request` merges it and pulls the result back into the local `main` checkout.

**Usage:** `/pull-request [commit message]`

- `/pull-request` - auto-generates a commit message from the diff
- `/pull-request added new e2e tests` - uses the provided text as the commit message

**User-provided commit message (if any):** $ARGUMENTS

## Pre-flight Checks

All git commands below run from the **current working directory** - never use `cd <path> && git
...` (triggers an unbypassable security prompt). Use `git -C <path>` to target another directory.

1. **Detect mode:**
   - If CWD contains `.kangentic/worktrees/` - **worktree mode** (the PR workflow below).
   - Otherwise - **main repo mode** (fall back to `/merge-back` behavior, see the note at the end).
2. Get the current branch name: `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`
   - If `HEAD` (detached) - warn the user and stop.
3. **Worktree mode only:** Derive the project root by walking up from the worktree path - the
   project root is two directories above `.kangentic/worktrees/<slug>/` (strip
   `.kangentic/worktrees/<slug>` from the worktree path).
4. Determine the source branch:
   - **Worktree mode:** `git config kangentic.baseBranch` (fallback: `main`).
   - **Main repo mode:** the current branch.
5. Run `git status --porcelain` to check for uncommitted changes.
6. Verify the GitHub CLI is authenticated: `gh auth status`. If it fails, report it and stop -
   this skill drives PR checks over `gh` and a long monitor loop must not start unauthenticated.

Report the mode, branch name, source branch, and working tree status before proceeding.

**Expect a commit you did not author.** Upstream of this column, the **Code Review** column runs
`/code-review` as a separate agent in the SAME worktree (`isolated` isolates the conversation, not
the filesystem), and it auto-fixes findings, adds tests, and commits that pass itself. So a
`fix(review):` / `refactor(review):` / `test(review):` commit on the branch is expected, not a
mistake. Leave it alone: do not squash it, reword it, or fold it into your own message - its
separate authorship is the point.

**And if the tree is dirty with changes you did not write**, that now means one of exactly two
things, because a finished review pass leaves the tree clean:

- The review pass is **still running**. Its commit has not landed yet.
- A review fix touched a file that was already dirty, so it was deliberately left uncommitted and
  mixed with someone else's work. The review's own footer lists those paths by name.

**Stage it and keep going. Do NOT ask the user whether to include it** - the answer is always yes,
so the question only costs a round trip. Everything in this worktree belongs to this task, so a
review pass's uncommitted fixes belong in this PR by definition. Splitting them out is not even
cleanly possible: review edits land INTERLEAVED inside files you also changed, so staging "only
your hunks" would drop your own work in those files too.

Still report what you found before committing, so the authorship is visible in the transcript: list
the dirty paths, say which carry changes you did not write, and summarize what that work does. Then
`git add -A` and proceed. If the extra work looks half-finished (a test that does not compile, a
dangling edit), say so and fix it as part of your commit rather than stopping.

**Main repo mode:** If detected, fall back to `/merge-back` behavior (Steps 0-5 of merge-back.md)
and stop. The PR workflow below applies to worktree mode only.

## Step 0 - Local gate (typecheck + lint only)

The point of this skill is to OFFLOAD the slow and flaky tiers to CI. Run only the fast, reliable
local gates so a trivially broken push does not waste a full CI round:

1. Ensure dependencies are present: if `node_modules` is missing (a fresh worktree - worktrees do
   not share `node_modules` with the main repo), run `npm install` first. If it fails with EBUSY, a
   file is locked by a running process; report it and stop.
2. Run `npm run typecheck`. If it fails, report the errors and stop.
3. Run `npm run lint`. ESLint runs in CI with `--max-warnings 0`, so any error will fail the push.
   If it reports errors, report them and stop. Warnings do not block.

Do NOT run the unit, UI, or E2E tiers locally - CI owns them. (`/test` is still available for a
manual local run when you want it.)

## Step 1 - Commit Changes

If there are uncommitted changes (non-empty `git status --porcelain` output):

1. Show the user `git status` and `git diff --stat` for a summary of changes.
2. **Determine the commit message:**
   - If `$ARGUMENTS` is non-empty:
     - Check if it already starts with a conventional commit prefix (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`,
       `chore:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `style:`, `perf:`, `ci:`, `build:`, or any of these with `!`
       before the colon).
     - If it does, use it as-is.
     - If it does not, analyze the diff to determine the appropriate type prefix and prepend it.
       For example: `/pull-request added dark mode` becomes `feat: added dark mode`.
   - If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty:
     - Read the full diff (`git diff`), draft a concise commit message.
     - The message **MUST** use conventional commit format.
     - Determine the primary change type from the diff:
       - `feat:` - new features or capabilities
       - `fix:` - bug fixes
       - `refactor:` - restructuring without behavior change
       - `chore:` - maintenance (deps, config, tooling)
       - `docs:` - documentation-only changes
       - `test:` - test-only changes
       - `style:` - formatting-only changes
       - `perf:` - performance improvements
       - `ci:` - CI/CD changes
       - `build:` - build system changes
     - If the change is breaking, add `!` after the type (e.g., `feat!:`)
     - Scope is optional but encouraged for multi-area changes (e.g., `feat(pty):`, `fix(db):`)
3. **Update documentation before staging** - targeted anchor check (do NOT invoke `/sync-docs` as a
   skill call):
   a. Identify changed source files (exclude `docs/`, `.claude/`, `tests/`).
   b. If no source files changed, skip to step 4.
   c. Read the canonical anchor list from `.claude/skills/sync-docs/SKILL.md` Step 2 ("Anchor Point
      Verification"). That file is the single source of truth - do not maintain a duplicate list
      here. The list contains both single-file anchors (e.g., `src/shared/types.ts`,
      `src/main/agent/agent-adapter.ts`) and glob anchors (e.g., `src/main/db/migrations/**`,
      `src/main/agent/adapters/**`, `src/main/ipc/handlers/**`).
   d. **Find the prose-drift candidates too, not just the anchor matches.** Anchor matching answers
      "you changed this file, does its doc still enumerate it" - it CANNOT catch a doc whose prose
      describes behavior that changed somewhere else. Real case: a PR changed how effort is
      resolved, and `docs/database.md` still called `applied_effort` "the ground truth". Its anchor
      is `src/main/db/migrations/**`, which that PR never touched, so no anchor rule would ever have
      selected it. Cheap fix: when the diff changes a **precedence chain, fallback order, or
      source of truth** for some value, take the identifiers in that chain and search `docs/` for
      each with the **Grep** tool (`bash-single-command.md` routes `grep` through it). Add every hit
      to the auditor's file list. Scope it to those identifiers, not every symbol the diff touches,
      or the list becomes noise: on that real case the chain identifiers hit 6 of 27 doc files and
      the top three were exactly the three that needed edits.
   e. Spawn a `doc-auditor` agent with the anchor matches plus any prose-drift candidates from (d).
      Ask it BOTH questions explicitly: does every doc still enumerate its anchors, AND has any
      prose describing this diff's behavior gone stale. The second is outside the agent's default
      contract (`.claude/agents/doc-auditor.md`: "Ignore prose"), so it answers it only when asked.
      Give it a short prose summary of what each changed file now does - a bare file list gets a
      bare enumeration check back.
   f. If the agent reports gaps, fix them inline using the `Edit` tool.
   g. Prose ACCURACY on the diff's own subject is in scope here, per (d) and (e). A general prose
      sweep of unrelated docs is not - that stays `/sync-docs`'s job.
4. Stage changes: `git add -A`
5. Write the commit message using the **Write tool** to the relative path
   `.kangentic/COMMIT_MSG.tmp` (resolved from CWD - do NOT resolve an absolute path, do NOT use the
   system temp directory, do NOT use `os.tmpdir()`).

   `.kangentic/` is gitignored, so `git add -A` won't stage it and no cleanup is needed.
   Then commit: `git commit -F .kangentic/COMMIT_MSG.tmp`
   **Never write to `.git/`** - in worktrees `.git` is a file, not a directory.
   **Never use `$(...)` or backtick command substitution** - triggers a safety prompt.

If the working tree is clean, there is nothing to stage - but **do not skip item 3.** A clean tree
usually means the Code Review pass already committed its own work (see the Pre-flight note), and
that commit can touch doc anchors nothing has audited yet: in one real case it changed
`src/main/db/migrations/project-schema.ts` and `src/main/ipc/handlers/task-move.ts`, both glob
anchors. So run item 3 against the **branch diff** instead of the uncommitted set
(`git diff --name-only origin/<sourceBranch>...HEAD`), commit any doc fixes it produces with a `docs:`
message, and then go to Step 1.5.

## Step 1.5 - Compute the clean PUBLIC branch name (never rename the local branch)

The local branch, the worktree folder, and `tasks.branch_name` together encode Kangentic's session
identity: on a Done->back round-trip the worktree folder is re-derived from them
(`src/main/git/worktree-manager.ts` `createWorktree`), and Claude keys its transcript by that
folder's path, so renaming the LOCAL branch to a non-auto name can recreate the worktree at a
different path and orphan the session. We therefore NEVER rename the local branch.

A branch only needs to look professional where it is PUBLIC: the remote branch and the PR head. We
push the unchanged local branch to a clean remote name and open the PR from that. PR state resolves
by `pr_number` (branch-independent; `src/main/pr/pr-linking.ts`), so the local-vs-remote name
mismatch is a non-issue once Step 5b links the number.

Compute `<branch>`, the clean public name. The local HEAD is the push SOURCE and is never touched:

1. `<type>` = the conventional prefix of the Step 1 commit message (`feat`, `fix`, `chore`, ...).
   If Step 1 created NO commit (a clean tree whose item 3 found no doc gap - now the common case,
   since the Code Review pass commits its own work and leaves the tree clean), there is no Step 1
   message to read: take the prefix of the most recent commit that is NOT a `*(review)` commit, and
   if there is none, default to `chore`.
2. `<desc>` = a clean kebab slug of the work. Resolve the task with `kangentic_get_current_task`
   (pass the worktree cwd + the local branch) and slugify its TITLE: lowercase, words joined by
   single hyphens, drop filler ("build", "the", "a", "add", "support for"), drop any trailing
   parenthetical or punctuation, cap to ~4-5 meaningful words. If `$ARGUMENTS` supplied a name,
   prefer it (strip a leading `<type>/`). Per the Conventional Branch spec: only `[a-z0-9-]`, no
   leading or trailing hyphen, no consecutive hyphens.
   - Example: "Build the in-app fluid window manager: modeless task windows" -> `in-app-window-manager`.
3. `<branch>` = `<type>/<desc>` (e.g. `feat/in-app-window-manager`). Every later step uses `<branch>`
   as the push TARGET and the PR head; the push SOURCE is always `HEAD` (the untouched local branch).
4. RESUMING: if the task already has a PR (`task.pr_number` set, or you previously pushed a remote
   branch for it), reuse that existing remote name as `<branch>` so the PR head stays valid - do not
   invent a new one.

## Step 2 - Fetch Latest Source Branch

Run: `git fetch origin <sourceBranch>`

Report if the fetch succeeded or if there were errors (e.g., no remote, authentication failure).

## Step 3 - Rebase onto Source Branch

Run: `git rebase origin/<sourceBranch>`

**If the rebase succeeds** - proceed to Step 3.5.

**If conflicts occur:**

1. Show the conflicting files using `git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U`
2. Ask the user which approach they prefer:
   - **Resolve conflicts** - open each conflicting file, edit the conflict markers, then `git add
     <file>` and `git rebase --continue`
   - **Abort entirely** - `git rebase --abort` and stop the process
3. If resolving conflicts: read each conflicting file, use `Edit` to resolve the conflict markers,
   stage the file, and continue the rebase. Repeat until all conflicts are resolved.

## Step 3.5 - Coverage pass (delegate to test-builder, gated)

Write any missing tests for the new functionality BEFORE the PR is created, so CI exercises them.

1. Compute the diff against the source branch: `git diff origin/<sourceBranch>...HEAD`.
2. If the diff touches no source files (docs/config/test-only), skip this step.
3. Otherwise spawn ONE `test-builder` agent in **write mode** scoped to the diff: "Audit coverage of
   this diff and implement any genuinely missing tests for the new functionality, following the tier
   rules and anti-flake patterns. Red-green each test. A clean no-op is fine if coverage is already
   adequate." Do not run the full suite locally - CI runs the new tests.
4. If `test-builder` wrote tests, stage and commit them with a `test:` message via
   `.kangentic/COMMIT_MSG.tmp` and `git commit -F .kangentic/COMMIT_MSG.tmp`.

Keep this proportional: a clean no-op on a thin or trivial diff is the expected outcome, so the
Testing column stays fast.

**Re-run any tests the Code Review pass added.** Those files went green when `/code-review` wrote
them, but against the tree as it stood **then** - and Step 3 has since rebased onto a source branch
that may well have moved.

Find them in the review commit rather than in the working tree; the pass committed itself, so they
are not sitting there untracked. Two Bash calls:

1. `git log --format=%H --grep="(review)" origin/<sourceBranch>..HEAD` to get the review commit(s). Keep
   the quotes; unquoted parentheses are a shell syntax error.
2. `git show --name-only --format= <sha>` and take the `tests/` paths. Use `--format=` rather than
   adding `--stat`: it suppresses the commit header so the output is bare paths, ready to pass
   straight to a scoped test run.

Then re-run each, scoped to the file itself:

- `npx vitest run tests/unit/<file>.test.ts`
- `npx playwright test tests/ui/<file>.spec.ts`

Only unit and UI files exist (`/code-review` flags E2E coverage holes rather than writing them), so
this is cheap. **Keep it scoped** - a scoped run of an added test file is explicitly allowed, but
`npm run test:unit` or a bare `npx vitest run` is a full-tier run this skill must not do. Fix a
failure here rather than spending a Step 7 round on it.

## Step 4 - Push the Branch

Run: `git push origin HEAD:<branch> --force-with-lease`

`--force-with-lease` is safe here (a personal worktree branch) and required after a rebase. If it
fails because someone else pushed to the branch, report it and stop - never bare `--force`.

## Step 5 - Create the Pull Request

1. **Determine PR title:** the first line of the most recent commit. If there are several commits
   since the source branch, combine them into one concise title. **Skip any `*(review)` commit** when
   deriving the title - it describes the audit pass, not the change the PR is for, and it is routinely
   the newest commit on the branch.
2. **Determine PR body:** write a rich, reviewer-facing body and save it to `.kangentic/PR_BODY.tmp`
   with the Write tool (avoids shell escaping). Mirror the section order of
   `.github/pull_request_template.md` so skill-created PRs match UI-created ones:
   - `## What` - what changed and the affected components.
   - `## Why` - the motivation or problem. Link any related issue with a closing keyword
     (e.g. `Closes #123`).
   - `## How` - the approach and any trade-offs worth a reviewer's attention.
   - `## Breaking changes` - any API, config, or behavioral change that requires user action, with
     migration notes; otherwise `None`.
   - `## Tests` - how it is verified (the CI checks plus any tests added in Step 3.5).
   - Footer: `Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)`
3. Run: `gh pr create --base <sourceBranch> --head <branch> --title "<title>" --body-file .kangentic/PR_BODY.tmp`

**If PR creation fails because one already exists:** run `gh pr view <branch>` and proceed to
Step 5b with the existing PR.

## Step 5b - Link the PR to the task

1. Extract the PR URL from the `gh pr create` output (or `gh pr view` if it already existed).
2. Parse the PR number from the URL (the numeric ID after `/pull/`).
3. Find the task with `kangentic_get_current_task` (pass the worktree cwd + the local branch).
   `<branch>` is the remote/PR name, NOT `tasks.branch_name`, so it is not a valid
   `kangentic_find_task` lookup key.
4. If a task is found, call `kangentic_update_task` with the task ID, `prUrl`, and `prNumber`.

This link is REQUIRED, not just best-effort: because `<branch>` (the PR head) differs from the
worktree's local HEAD by design, Kangentic's branch-based auto-detection will NOT find this PR - the
stored `pr_number` is the only thing connecting the task to it. If the update fails, retry it; do
not leave the task unlinked.

**If the kangentic MCP is unavailable** (it can disconnect/reconnect mid-run): the PR work itself
does not need it - only the Step 1.5 slug and this link do. Do not abort. For the slug, fall back to
deriving `<desc>` from the commit messages instead of the task title. For the link, keep going (the
PR is created and pushed) and retry `kangentic_get_current_task` + `kangentic_update_task` once the
MCP is back (the notification fires when it reconnects); if it never returns this run, report the PR
number prominently so the user can link it in-app.

## Step 6 - Monitor checks until green

Wait for the PR's CI checks to finish, then branch on the outcome. Use `gh pr checks` in watch mode
rather than a manual poll loop (no `sleep` - the single-command rule forbids it):

1. The PR head is `<branch>` (the clean public name from Step 1.5), so `gh pr checks <branch>`
   resolves it. The local HEAD differs by design; PR resolution does not need them to match.
2. Run `gh pr checks <branch> --watch --fail-fast --interval 30` with the Bash tool `timeout` set to
   its MAXIMUM of `600000` ms (10 minutes). Do NOT pass a larger value: the Bash tool clamps/rejects
   anything over 600000, so the old "40 minutes" figure is not actually achievable in one call.
   `--watch` returns when the checks settle; `--fail-fast` returns as soon as one fails so the fix
   loop starts promptly. The sharded Linux E2E and UI jobs are the long pole (a few minutes; longer
   on a cold runner).

   Expect a non-zero exit while checks are unfinished. `gh pr checks` returns exit code `8` when not
   all checks have passed yet (still pending OR a genuine failure), which the Bash tool surfaces as a
   "Bash error exit code 8". That is STATUS, not a tooling failure - read the printed rows to decide.
   Do NOT run a bare `gh pr checks <branch>` (without `--watch`) as a pre-flight probe: it always
   exits 8 while anything is pending and only adds a scary-looking error to the transcript. Go
   straight to the `--watch` form, which exits 0 once every row reads `pass`.
3. Interpret the result:
   - **All checks passed** (every row `pass`; the watch exited 0): go to Step 6b (flake scan).
   - **A check failed** (a `fail`/`failure` row, or `--fail-fast` returned on a failure): go to
     Step 7 (auto-fix).
   - **The 10-minute Bash timeout fired with checks still only pending** (no failure yet, just
     slow): RE-RUN the same `--watch` command - it resumes from the current state. Repeat as needed.
     Only when the checks have made NO forward progress across two consecutive full 10-minute watches
     (genuinely stuck, not merely slow) go to Step 8b (escalate, stuck checks).

## Step 6b - Flake scan (ZERO flaky tolerance)

A test that fails then passes on retry still counts as a failure here. CI runs the UI and Electron
projects with `retries: 1`, so a flake can show up as a GREEN check. Do not accept green-via-retry:

1. Identify the latest CI run for `<branch>` (`gh pr checks <branch> --json name,state,link` to find
   the run, then `gh run view <run-id>`).
2. Inspect the UI and E2E job output for any test that needed a retry (Playwright reports these as
   "flaky"). Retrieve the job log if needed to confirm.
3. If any flaky test is found, treat it exactly like a failure and go to Step 7 to de-flake it. Only
   when the checks are green AND no test was retried do you proceed to Step 8.

## Step 7 - Auto-fix loop (max 3 rounds, fully automatic)

Do NOT pause to ask. Each round, diagnose every failing or flaky check and fix it, then push and
re-monitor. Hard cap: 3 rounds. After the 3rd unsuccessful round, go to Step 8b.

For each round:

1. Pull the failure detail: `gh run view <run-id> --log-failed` (and the full job log for a flake
   that passed on retry).
2. Classify each problem and act automatically:
   - **Real regression** (the code is wrong): fix the code with `Edit`.
   - **Broken or wrong test** (the code is right, the assertion is stale): fix the test. Delegate
     non-trivial test fixes to a `test-builder` agent. Cross-platform parity
     (`.claude/rules/cross-platform-parity.md`) is the usual cause of a test that is green locally
     on Windows but red on CI's Linux runner.
   - **Review-added test gone stale** (the failing test came from the Code Review pass): it passed
     when `/code-review` wrote it, but against the pre-rebase base. A failure is more likely drift
     from the moved base than a regression in your own code, so read what it asserts before
     changing production code to satisfy it. If Step 3.5 already re-ran it green, this is not the
     explanation and it is a real regression.
   - **Flaky test** (passed on retry, or intermittent across shards/runs): do NOT accept it.
     Delegate to `test-builder` to rewrite it deterministically (replace fixed waits with conditional
     polls, disambiguate selectors, etc.). If it is genuinely unsalvageable, remove it with an
     explicit justification in the commit body. Leave NO flaky tests behind.
3. **Re-check doc anchors when a fix touched one.** Step 1 item 3 audited anchors, but it ran before
   this loop, so a fix committed here can touch an anchor nothing has audited. If any file you just
   edited matches the canonical anchor list in `.claude/skills/sync-docs/SKILL.md` Step 2, spawn a
   `doc-auditor` on those files and fix any gap inline before committing. Do it HERE: this push is
   happening anyway, so it costs no extra CI round, whereas leaving the gap for
   `/merge-pull-request` to find makes that skill push a `docs:` commit at merge time and wait out a
   second full CI run.
4. Commit the fixes (conventional message via `.kangentic/COMMIT_MSG.tmp`), then push:
   `git push origin HEAD:<branch> --force-with-lease`.
5. Return to Step 6 to re-monitor.

## Step 8 - Report (success)

The PR is green and flake-free. Report:
- PR URL (with link) and branch name.
- Number of commits and any tests written (Step 3.5) or rewritten/removed (Step 7).
- "All checks green, no flaky tests."
- Next step: the user moves the task Testing -> Merge, where `/merge-pull-request` merges it.

**Do NOT merge.** Merging is `/merge-pull-request`'s job.

## Step 8b - Escalate (after 3 rounds, or stuck checks)

Stop. Do not start a 4th round and do not `--admin` bypass. Leave the PR open, pushed, and with no
half-finished rebase. Report concrete, learned recommendations so a human can finish quickly:
- For each still-failing or flaky check: the classification, what each round tried, and the root
  cause as far as you determined it.
- Specific recommendations, e.g. "remove test X - root cause Y, not fixable", "rewrite test Z to
  poll for <condition>", or "the regression is in `<file>:<line>`".
- The PR URL and the current red/pending check summary.

## Rules

**CRITICAL: No chained commands.** Every Bash call must contain exactly ONE command. Never use
`&&`, `||`, `|`, or `;`. For git commands in another directory, use `git -C <path>` - never `cd
<path> && git ...`. Conventional commit messages. No em-dashes or `--` as punctuation.

**Never fork a side-check while this skill is active.** A `subagent_type: "fork"` agent inherits
the full conversation context, including these very instructions. Spawning one to "check on" a
background agent (e.g. the Step 1.3 `doc-auditor`) with an ambiguous prompt can cause it to pick
up and independently execute the REST of this skill (commit, push, create a duplicate PR). To
check on a background agent, wait for its natural `<task-notification>` instead of spawning
another agent.
