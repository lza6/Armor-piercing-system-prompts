# VSS Video Embedding (RT-Embed)

Use this skill for the RT-Embed video embedding microservice, including the
standard Cosmos-Embed1 deployment path and custom/BYOM embedding model work.

**Trigger phrases:** `vss-deploy-video-embedding`, `RT-Embed`, `rtvi-embed`,
`video embedding service`, `Cosmos-Embed1`, `embed live stream`, `embed video
file`, `generate video embeddings`, `text embedding for video search`,
`RT-Embed BYOM`, `VideoPrism embed`, `custom embed model`,
`MODEL_IMPLEMENTATION_PATH`, `MODEL_REPOSITORY_SCRIPT_PATH`, `bring your own
embedding model`.

**Do not use this skill** for RT-CV, RT-VLM, VSS Agent, or general VSS
deployment work unless the request deploys, operates, integrates, or customizes
RT-Embed.

## Service Snapshot

- **Skill:** `vss-deploy-video-embedding`.
- **Legacy 3.1 name:** RT-Embed.
- **Compose service:** `rtvi-embed`.
- **Container name:** `vss-rtvi-embed`.
- **Image:** `ghcr.io/nvidia-ai-blueprints/vss/vss-rt-embed` (override with `VSS_RT_EMBED_IMAGE`).
- **Default tag:** `develop-latest` (override with `VSS_RT_EMBED_TAG`; use `develop-latest-sbsa` for an SBSA/DGX Spark host).
- **Profile:** `rtvi-embed`.
- **Container port:** `8000` (host-side `${RTVI_EMBED_PORT}`).
- **Default model:** `cosmos-embed1-448p` from `nvidia/Cosmos-Embed1-448p`.
- **BYOM loader variables:** `MODEL_PATH`, `MODEL_IMPLEMENTATION_PATH`, `MODEL_REPOSITORY_SCRIPT_PATH`.
- **Health endpoint:** `GET /v1/ready`.
- **Healthcheck startup grace:** `1200s` (20 minutes) on first boot.

## Route First

Choose one primary path before acting. Load the linked reference and follow it;
do not duplicate full workflows from this top-level file.

| User intent | Use this path |
|---|---|
| Deploy, size, upgrade, roll back, or tear down standalone RT-Embed with the default Cosmos-Embed1 model | [`references/deploy-vss-deploy-video-embedding.md`](references/deploy-vss-deploy-video-embedding.md) |
| Call RT-Embed APIs for files, text/video embeddings, live streams, model listing, health, metrics, metadata, or manifests | [`references/rest-api.md`](references/rest-api.md) |
| Wire RT-Embed into another service or deployment with Redis, Kafka, OpenTelemetry, auth, storage, or env var mapping | [`references/integrate-vss-deploy-video-embedding.md`](references/integrate-vss-deploy-video-embedding.md) and [`references/environment.md`](references/environment.md) |
| Use decoded-frame IPC from a compatible RTVI CV producer | [`references/environment.md#decoded-frame-ipc`](references/environment.md#decoded-frame-ipc) and [`references/integrate-vss-deploy-video-embedding.md`](references/integrate-vss-deploy-video-embedding.md) |
| Add, wire, or validate a custom/BYOM embedding backend, with VideoPrism as an example | [`references/byom-custom-model.md`](references/byom-custom-model.md) |
| Debug readiness, model/cache startup, permissions, Redis/Kafka reachability, API failures, or observability | [`references/troubleshooting.md`](references/troubleshooting.md) |

Selection rules:

- If asked which skill handles default Cosmos-Embed1 RT-Embed deployment,
  answer: use `vss-deploy-video-embedding`; this is the default deployment path,
  not the BYOM/custom-model path.
- For normal RT-Embed or Cosmos-Embed1 deployment, use the deployment reference.
  In the answer, explicitly say that this is the default RT-Embed deployment
  path. Also explicitly distinguish it from BYOM/custom model integration:
  BYOM is only for adding or validating non-default custom embedding backends
  such as VideoPrism, and is not needed for the default Cosmos-Embed1 model.
- For BYOM, custom embedding models, VideoPrism examples, or model implementation path questions,
  use the BYOM reference first, then deployment/API references only as needed.
- For direct endpoint calls, use the API reference and reuse deployment context
  only when the service is not already running.
- Decoded-frame IPC requires a compatible RTVI CV producer on the same host, a
  shared socket directory accessible to UID/GID `1001`, and a matching camera
  ID. The consumer uses the fixed `/run/rtvi-ipc/nvds_ipc_{camera_id}.sock`
  socket contract. IPC camera, sensor, and stream IDs must be non-empty and
  contain only ASCII letters, digits, `.`, `_`, and `-`; standard UUIDs are
  valid. It applies only to live RTSP processing.
- If the request mixes deployment and BYOM, load BYOM first to establish model
  path requirements, then use the deployment reference to run the service.

## Operating Rules

- Do not deploy a full VSS profile for standalone RT-Embed. Work from
  `deploy/docker/services/rtvi/rtvi-embed` unless the user explicitly asks for a
  profile deployment.
- Never let `sudo` prompt interactively. Prefer plain `docker`; otherwise use
  `sudo -n docker` and stop with the exact manual command if passwordless sudo is
  unavailable.
- Do not expose full values of `NGC_API_KEY`, `HF_TOKEN`, bearer tokens, or model
  repository credentials in prompts, logs, or final answers.
- Do not shorten the `start_period: 1200s` healthcheck during first boot. Cosmos
  model download and Triton model repository generation can take up to 20 minutes.
- In standalone mode, disable missing peers with `MESSAGE_BUS=`, `ERROR_BUS=`,
  and `ENABLE_REDIS_ERROR_MESSAGES=false` unless the corresponding Kafka or Redis
  service is started and reachable.
- For BYOM models that are video-only, require an explicit text endpoint decision:
  either a compatible text encoder in the same embedding space or a clear 4xx
  response for `/v1/generate_text_embeddings`.
