# seedance-vocab-ko

Before producing prompt text, a prompt-ready block, a rewrite, an example, or a compiled clip, load the [Director's Read](../../references/directors-read.md), classify the brief, and complete its canonical narrative or non-narrative record. Translate that record into visible or audible carriers and keep its internal labels out of final generation prose.

Use Korean cinematic vocabulary when the user asks for Korean prompt wording, bilingual delivery, compact translation, or production vocabulary for camera, lighting, action, VFX, audio, and constraints. Preserve actual reference tags exactly; their spelling is independent of the prompt language.

Before adapting a reference example below, load [Using Reference Examples](../../references/surface-prompt-profiles.md#using-reference-examples). Bind its placeholders to real assets by the requested role, then preserve the actual token, including its script, case, spacing and punctuation. A written example token does not attach a file.

## Intent

Korean prompt direction should preserve useful mood or style terms and clarify ambiguous intent through observable light, framing, blocking, or timing. Keep the relationship and speech level explicit whenever dialogue is added. The shipped independent review artifact is empty, so treat these choices as working production wording pending locale-specialist review.

## Usage Rule

Translate the production intention rather than every English word. Keep the Korean prompt compact and concrete: subject, action, camera, light, sound, and preservation constraint.

| Function | Korean wording |
|---|---|
| Camera | `느린 돌리 인`, `측면 트래킹 샷`, `고정된 미디엄 샷`, `로우 앵글`, `클로즈업` |
| Lighting | `역광`, `부드러운 창문 빛`, `따뜻한 프랙티컬 조명`, `차가운 달빛`, `림 라이트` |
| Motion | `천천히 돌아선다`, `프레임을 빠르게 가로지른다`, `물방울이 아래로 흐른다`, `연기가 얇게 퍼진다` |
| Audio | `조용한 환경음`, `짧은 대사`, `부드러운 금속음`, `음악 없음` |
| Constraints | `로고, 라벨, 형태를 정확히 유지한다` |

## Compact Pattern

`@Image1은 참조 이미지이며 얼굴/제품 형태/로고를 정확히 유지한다. 변화는 [동작/조명/카메라]만 적용한다. 카메라: [한 가지 움직임]. 사운드: [음향 지시].`

## Speech Level Rule

Preserve user-supplied dialogue. When drafting or adapting speech, load Speech Level (말투) in [the vocabulary guide](../../references/vocab/ko.md) and keep the relationship and intended tone explicit. Offer register choices only where they affect the brief. Measure the actual spoken line; do not use a fixed multiplier or change politeness to fit an invented sync budget. Record any unresolved locale-review need.

## De-Slop Rule

When an adjective leaves the intended shot unclear, load Slop Traps in [Korean vocabulary](../../references/vocab/ko.md). Preserve a useful style or aesthetic term and add only the scene-specific action, framing, light, or sound needed to clarify it. The table offers authored options, not a default look or a proven model-performance rule. Keep the user's chosen energy, dialogue, reference tags, and settings. Offer distinct choices only when the ambiguity changes the scene; if the user delegated the choice, decide within that scope.

## Output Contract

Return Korean prompt wording, optional English gloss when useful, and unchanged reference tags.
