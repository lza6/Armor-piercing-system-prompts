# test-fidelity — lens mandate

Executed by `tribunal-lens-reviewer` under the `test-fidelity` assignment. Write contract + evidence discipline: `finding-record.md`. Report observable state only; do not assert "written because the producer was absent" unless a comment says so.

## Scope emphasis
Test files and fixtures in the assigned slice. Doubles, fabricated literals, escape hatches, temporariness confessions.

## Required reading
- `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.codearbiter/tech-stack.md` — mock patterns, fixture/factory conventions, the real producers (serializers, DTOs, queries).

## Checklist
- Tests validating fiction: mocks/stubs/fabricated literals that should now be sourced from a real producer. Signals: `vi.mock`/`jest.mock`, `mockReturnValue`/`mockResolvedValue`/`mockImplementation`, `sinon.stub`, manual doubles, large inline domain-typed literals in fixtures/`beforeEach`.
- Type-escape hatches hiding drift from the compiler: the typesafety lens's escape-hatch list (`typesafety.md`), scoped to test code.
- Temporariness confessions: `TODO`/`FIXME`/`HACK`, "stub until X exists/ready/implemented".
- Cross-reference: does a real producer now exist (factory/builder, serializer/DTO, query/seed, the real module behind the mock)? Side-by-side drift evidence — missing now-required field, stale enum, wrong nullability — raises confidence.

## Category
`maintainability` by default; rises to `reliability` if the drift could let a real defect through — a test validating fiction actively masks regressions.

## Exposure
Count of test doubles/fixtures examined.

## Out of scope
Coverage gaps (coverage).
