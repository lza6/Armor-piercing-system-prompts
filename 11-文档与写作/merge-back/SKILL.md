description: Direct quick-push escape hatch - commit, rebase, and push straight to the source branch, bypassing the PR gate. Use only when the user explicitly asks to push, land, or merge back a quick change. The normal flow is the board (Testing -> /pull-request, Merge -> /merge-pull-request). NOT for a plain local commit (use /commit for that).

# Merge Back

Safely commit, rebase, and push changes straight to the source branch. Works from both worktrees and
the main repo.

This is the **direct quick-push escape hatch**: it bypasses the pull-request gate, so it relies on
admin push access (`enforce_admins` is off on `main`). It is no longer wired to a board column. The
normal flow now goes through a PR: the **Testing** column runs `/pull-request` (create a PR and drive
its checks green) and the **Merge** column runs `/merge-pull-request` (merge the green PR and pull
back). Reach for `/merge-back` only for a small, urgent change you want to land without a PR (e.g.
CI is down, or a one-line hotfix).

**Usage:** `/merge-back [commit message]`

- `/merge-back` - auto-generates a commit message from the diff
- `/merge-back added new e2e tests` - uses the provided text as the commit message

**User-provided commit message (if any):** $ARGUMENTS

## Pre-flight Checks

All git commands below run from the **current working directory** - never use `cd <path> && git ...` (triggers an unbypasable security prompt). The only exception is Step 6 which uses `git -C <projectRoot>` to target the main repo.

1. **Detect mode:**
   - If CWD contains `.kangentic/worktrees/` → **worktree mode**
   - Otherwise → **main repo mode**
2. Get the current branch name: `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`
   - If `HEAD` (detached) → warn the user and stop.
3. **Worktree mode only:** Derive the project root by walking up from the worktree path - the project root is two directories above `.kangentic/worktrees/<slug>/` (i.e., strip `.kangentic/worktrees/<slug>` from the worktree path).
4. Determine the source branch:
   - **Worktree mode:** `git config kangentic.baseBranch` (fallback: `main`)
   - **Main repo mode:** same as the current branch (push to own remote tracking branch)
5. Run `git status --porcelain` to check for uncommitted changes.

Report the mode, branch name, source branch, and working tree status before proceeding.

## Step 0 - Install Dependencies, Type Check, Lint, and Guard

1. Run `node scripts/verify-node-modules.js`. It compares `node_modules/.package-lock.json` against `package-lock.json` and prints which way it went. Act on its exit code with no judgment call and no prompt to the user. **Exit 0:** the tree already matches the lockfile, so continue. **Exit 1 or 2:** run `npm ci`, then re-run the verifier; if `npm ci` fails with EBUSY, stop with: "A file in node_modules is locked by a running process. Close the Kangentic dev server (`npm start`) and retry." Do not run `npm ci` unconditionally: it deletes `node_modules`, which the live dev server is usually running Electron out of.
2. Run `npm run typecheck`. If it fails, report the type errors and stop - do not proceed with the merge. Type errors must be fixed before merging back.
3. Run `npm run lint`. ESLint runs in CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`), so a lint error will fail the push you are about to make. If it reports any errors, report them and stop - fix them before merging back. Warnings (e.g. `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps`) do not fail lint and do not block the merge.
4. Run `npx vitest run tests/unit/test-fs-writes-sandboxed.test.ts`. This is a sub-second static scan that catches a test writing to a hardcoded absolute root (e.g. `/projects/new-app`), which is green on a Windows dev drive but `EACCES` on CI's Linux runner - the failure mode that kept `main` red for days. The full unit tier runs on CI as a PR check (the Testing column's `/pull-request` monitor loop); this single-file guard is the fast pre-push backstop for a test edited after that gate or a merge-back that skipped it. If it fails, report the offending `file:line` and stop - move the write under `os.tmpdir()` before merging back. Enforces `.claude/rules/cross-platform-parity.md`.

## Step 1 - Commit Changes

If there are uncommitted changes (non-empty `git status --porcelain` output):

1. Show the user `git status` and `git diff --stat` for a summary of changes.
2. **Determine the commit message:**
   - If `$ARGUMENTS` is non-empty:
     - Check if it already starts with a conventional commit prefix (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `style:`, `perf:`, `ci:`, `build:`, or any of these with `!` before the colon).
     - If it does, use it as-is.
     - If it does not, analyze the diff to determine the appropriate type prefix and prepend it. For example: `/merge-back added dark mode` becomes `feat: added dark mode`.
   - If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty:
     - Read the full diff (`git diff`), draft a concise commit message.
     - The message **MUST** use conventional commit format.
     - Determine the primary change type from the diff:
       - `feat:` - new features or capabilities
       - `fix:` - bug fixes
       - `refactor:` - restructuring without behavior change
       - `chore:` - maintenance (deps, config, tooling)
       - `docs:` - documentation-only changes
       - `test:` - test-only changes
       - `style:` - formatting-only changes
       - `perf:` - performance improvements
       - `ci:` - CI/CD changes
       - `build:` - build system changes
     - If the change is breaking, add `!` after the type (e.g., `feat!:`)
     - Scope is optional but encouraged for multi-area changes (e.g., `feat(pty):`, `fix(db):`)
3. **Update documentation before staging** - targeted anchor check (do NOT invoke `/sync-docs` as a skill call):
   a. Identify changed source files (exclude `docs/`, `.claude/`, `tests/`).
   b. If no source files changed, skip to step 4.
   c. Read the canonical anchor list from `.claude/skills/sync-docs/SKILL.md` Step 2 ("Anchor Point Verification"). That file is the single source of truth - do not maintain a duplicate list here. The list contains both single-file anchors (e.g., `src/shared/types.ts`, `src/main/agent/agent-adapter.ts`) and glob anchors (e.g., `src/main/db/migrations/**`, `src/main/agent/adapters/**`, `src/main/ipc/handlers/**`).
   d. If any changed file matches an anchor entry (single file or glob), spawn a `doc-auditor` agent with the matching files.
   e. If the agent reports gaps, fix them inline using the `Edit` tool.
   f. No general prose review here (that is `/sync-docs`'s job).
4. Stage changes: `git add -A`

   **This skill pushes straight to the source branch with no CI gate**, so anything swept in here
   lands unreviewed. If the tree holds changes this session did not write, a `/code-review` pass may
   still be running in this worktree, or it finished and deliberately left a mixed-authorship path
   uncommitted - see the Code Review note in `.claude/skills/pull-request/SKILL.md` **Pre-flight
   Checks**, and confirm with the user before staging.
5. Write the commit message using the **Write tool** to the relative path `.kangentic/COMMIT_MSG.tmp` (resolved from CWD - do NOT resolve an absolute path, do NOT use the system temp directory, do NOT use `os.tmpdir()`).

   `.kangentic/` is gitignored, so `git add -A` won't stage it and no cleanup is needed.
   Then commit: `git commit -F .kangentic/COMMIT_MSG.tmp`
   **Never write to `.git/`** - in worktrees `.git` is a file, not a directory.
   **Never use `$(...)` or backtick command substitution** - triggers a safety prompt.

If the working tree is clean, skip to Step 2.

## Step 2 - Fetch Latest Source Branch

Run: `git fetch origin <sourceBranch>`

Report if the fetch succeeded or if there were errors (e.g., no remote, authentication failure).

## Step 3 - Rebase onto Source Branch

Run: `git rebase origin/<sourceBranch>`

**If the rebase succeeds** - proceed to Step 4.

**If conflicts occur:**

1. Show the conflicting files using `git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U`
2. Ask the user which approach they prefer:
   - **Resolve conflicts** - open each conflicting file, edit the conflict markers, then `git add <file>` and `git rebase --continue`
   - **Abort and merge instead** - `git rebase --abort` then `git merge origin/<sourceBranch>` (creates a merge commit)
   - **Abort entirely** - `git rebase --abort` and stop the merge-back process
3. If resolving conflicts: read each conflicting file, use `Edit` to resolve the conflict markers, stage the file, and continue the rebase. Repeat until all conflicts are resolved.

## Step 4 - Push to Source Branch

**Worktree mode:** Push to the **source branch** (e.g., `main`), NOT the worktree branch name. The worktree branch is a local working branch only. The goal is to land commits directly on the source branch.

Run: `git push origin HEAD:<sourceBranch>`

This pushes the rebased commits directly to the remote source branch. After a successful rebase, this is guaranteed to be a fast-forward push.

**If the push fails** (e.g., someone else pushed in the meantime):

1. Report the error clearly.
2. Suggest re-running `/merge-back` to fetch the latest and rebase again.
3. Stop - do not force-push.

## Step 5 - Report

Summarize:
- Mode (worktree or main repo)
- Branch name that was merged
- Source branch that received the changes
- Number of commits landed (from `git log origin/<sourceBranch>@{1}..origin/<sourceBranch> --oneline` or similar)
- **Worktree mode only:** Remind the user they can clean up the worktree by moving the task to Done on the board (which triggers `cleanup_worktree`) or manually

## Step 6 - Update Local Source Branch (worktree mode only, always runs after Step 5)

**Skip this step entirely in main repo mode** - you're already on the branch.

The project root (determined in pre-flight step 3) always has the source branch checked out. Keeping it in sync matters: it is the dogfooding checkout (`npm start` serves the main process from it).

1. Fast-forward it: `git -C <projectRoot> pull --ff-only`. If this succeeds, you are done.

2. **If it fails, do NOT just log a soft warning - that is how divergence compounds.** A fast-forward is impossible the moment the local source branch has even one commit the remote lacks, so a single direct commit to the local checkout makes THIS step fail on every future merge-back, and the checkout silently drifts further behind each run. Diagnose and surface it loudly:

   a. Run `git -C <projectRoot> status -sb` to read the ahead/behind counts.
   b. If the local branch is **behind only** (ahead 0) and the ff still failed, the working tree likely has uncommitted changes. Report that and stop - do not stash or discard the user's work.
   c. If the local branch is **ahead** (has unpushed local commits), list them with `git -C <projectRoot> log --oneline origin/<sourceBranch>..<sourceBranch>` and name them in the report. These are the snowball: each blocks every future ff-pull until reconciled.

3. **Offer to reconcile the ahead case** (do not do it silently - the user may want to drop a local-only commit rather than carry it forward):
   - Rebase: `git -C <projectRoot> rebase origin/<sourceBranch>` (replays the local commits on top of the remote).
   - If the user wants those commits on the source branch, push: `git -C <projectRoot> push origin <sourceBranch>`.
   - **On conflict, abort cleanly:** `git -C <projectRoot> rebase --abort`, then report the manual steps. NEVER leave the running dogfooding checkout in a half-finished rebase.

The remote source branch is already updated by Step 4 regardless, so a failure here is non-fatal to the merge - but it is not "ignore and move on": an un-surfaced local commit will keep breaking this step.

**Prevention:** the local source-branch checkout should only ever fast-forward. Do not commit directly to it - use a worktree or feature branch. A direct commit to the local source branch is the root cause of the divergence this step has to repair.

## Rules

**CRITICAL: No chained commands.** Every Bash call must contain exactly ONE command. Never use `&&`, `||`, `|`, or `;`. For git commands in another directory, use `git -C <path>` - never `cd <path> && git ...`.

Conventional commit messages, written in the house style (see `.claude/rules/writing-style.md`).
