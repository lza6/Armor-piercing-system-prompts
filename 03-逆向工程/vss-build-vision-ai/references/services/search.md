# Search Capability Owner

## Capabilities and service keys

| Capability | Canonical service profile keys |
|---|---|
| Search analytics and indexing flow | `vss-search-analytics-2d-fusion` |

## Required peers

- Requires RT-CV, RT-Embed, Elasticsearch, Kafka, Logstash, and the Search
  profile's VIOS/NvStreamer path.
- Agent search requires `COSMOS_EMBED_ENDPOINT`, `ELASTIC_SEARCH_ENDPOINT`, and
  `ELASTIC_SEARCH_INDEX`.
- Result critique and visual follow-up Q&A are served by RT-VLM **through the
  agent**; there is no build-time critique env flag. Critique is chosen **per
  request** (the agent's `use_critic` option, default on) — never at deploy
  time. Include `rtvi-vlm` together with the `vss-agent` tier that invokes it
  only when the build must serve those agent surfaces. A headless build (no
  `vss-agent`) has no consumer for `rtvi-vlm` — the retrieval CLI never calls
  it — so omit both. Do **not** introduce an `ENABLE_CRITIC` (or equivalent)
  env delta; the search profile no longer honors one.
- `vss-video-analytics-api` is a **separate** service key from
  `vss-search-analytics-2d-fusion`. The analytics API (`:9901`) provides the
  REST query/browse surface over ES indices; the search-analytics service is the
  Behavior-Analytics container that produces `mdx-embed-filtered` and
  `mdx-behavior`. Both are in the Search Foundation's service set; do not
  confuse or substitute one for the other. Like the ingress, the analytics API is
  an exposed read surface — include it only when the request asks to expose a
  query/browse/REST surface, and prune it otherwise even though the Foundation
  ships it. It is a shared singleton: include `vss-video-analytics-api` when
  required, and never introduce a second API key or container.
- When this container also serves another capability on one shared instance (a
  combined build), it is the shared **Behavior-Analytics** instance — converge its
  mounted JSON config per [`behavior-analytics.md`](behavior-analytics.md); its
  operating mode (`numWorkersFor*` gates) is not env-expressible.

## Write-path topic flow

Surface this topic-level flow in the architecture preview (SKILL.md step 6
requires principal data flows and topics); it is authoritatively defined in
`skills/deployment/vss-setup-behavior-analytics/references/integrate-behavior-analytics-service.md`.

- Detection: `perception-2d-fusion -> mdx-raw`.
- Embeddings: `rtvi-embed -> mdx-embed -> vss-search-analytics-2d-fusion ->
  mdx-embed-filtered`. `vss-search-analytics-2d-fusion` is the **sole** producer of
  `mdx-embed-filtered`.
- Behaviors: `vss-search-analytics-2d-fusion -> mdx-behavior`.
- Indexing: Logstash consumes these output topics into Elasticsearch index
  patterns `mdx-raw-*`, `mdx-behavior-*`, and `mdx-embed-filtered-*`.

## Configuration knobs

| Environment variable | Use |
|---|---|
| `VSS_BEHAVIOR_ANALYTICS_IMAGE`, `VSS_BEHAVIOR_ANALYTICS_TAG` | Select the Search analytics image inherited from Behavior Analytics. |
| `STREAM_TYPE` | Select the checked-in Kafka or Redis analytics config. |
| `COSMOS_EMBED_ENDPOINT` | Point the Agent at RT-Embed. |
| `ELASTIC_SEARCH_ENDPOINT`, `ELASTIC_SEARCH_INDEX` | Point the Agent at indexed search data. |
