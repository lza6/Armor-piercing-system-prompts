## Excluded Paths

Excluded from runtime skill extraction except where named as evidence above:

- `.git/`, caches, bytecode, build outputs, and temporary files
- model artifact directories under `models/` except `models/configs/`
- runtime user data/output directories such as `input/` and `output/`
- CI/release packaging internals not needed for user-facing workflows
- DisCo review/test artifacts under `skills/tests/`

## Inspection Notes

- Public runtime claims are based on repository source, package metadata, local tests/examples, and private package-inspection facts.
- Full ComfyUI execution can require optional model files, frontend/template packages, hosted API credentials, and hardware-specific torch/backend support.
- Future refresh checks should compare the commit, version, dirty-state summary, CLI flags, API routes, node API files, model path behavior, and bundled scripts against the current repository before reusing this skill unchanged.
