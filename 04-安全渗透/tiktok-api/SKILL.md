# TikTok API — Transport + Ingestion for a Real Account

*You own the wire: authenticate to a TikTok account, publish video, pull the numbers, and write those numbers into the wiki as a durable feedback log. You do not decide what to make, when to post it, or how to caption it — that is the shortform strategy/packaging family. Deliver clean transport and a queryable log; let the siblings interpret.*

TikTok splits across **three** separate APIs, and a real account touches all three:

- **Content Posting API** — `https://open.tiktokapis.com/v2/post/publish/...` — the *write* side: init a publish, transfer the file, poll status. Audit-gated.
- **Display API** — `https://open.tiktokapis.com/v2/video/...` — the *cheap read* side: your own profile and basic per-video counters (`view_count, like_count, comment_count, share_count`).
- **TikTok API for Business** — the *rich read* side: watch time, completion, impression sources. Enabled through a **separate business portal**, not the standard developer app.

Auth is **user OAuth v2 via Login Kit**, never a service token. A human owns the account; you act on their behalf with a refresh token. There is **no official TikTok SDK** — you call the REST endpoints directly with any HTTP client. Treat the access token as a short-lived, refreshable credential object, never a hardcoded literal.

## When to use / When NOT

Use when:

- Wiring a script or agent to publish to an account: Direct Post or upload-to-draft via `/v2/post/publish/video/init/` (or `/inbox/` for a draft), then `FILE_UPLOAD` chunked PUT or `PULL_FROM_URL`, then poll `/v2/post/publish/status/fetch/`.
- Pulling an account's own video stats: counters via Display `POST /v2/video/query/` (or `/v2/video/list/`); watch-time / completion / impression-source via the Business Account API.
- Building the recurring "fetch performance → write to `02-DOCS/wiki/shortform/`" loop that turns API responses into an account feedback log siblings can read.
- Debugging TikTok-specific failures: `scope_not_authorized`, `url_ownership_unverified`, `rate_limit_exceeded` (6 req/min), 24-hour access-token expiry, audit/`video.publish` not approved, unaudited-app private-only posting.

Do NOT use when (route to the sibling that owns it):

| You actually want | Go to |
| --- | --- |
| What to post / cadence / niche / hook strategy | `shortform-strategy` *(catalog id)* |
| Clip ideas, hooks, a topic backlog | `shortform-ideation` *(catalog id)* |
| Caption / cover / title packaging, A/B framing | `shortform-packaging` *(catalog id)* |
| Cut/caption/render the actual clip file | `shortform-editing` *(catalog id)* |
| Render a video file programmatically | `../remotion-video/SKILL.md` |
| Post one asset to TikTok + IG + YouTube at once | `../social-publisher/SKILL.md` |
| Instagram's Graph / Content Publishing API | `../instagram-api/SKILL.md` |
| YouTube's two APIs (same family, other platform) | `../youtube-api/SKILL.md` |
| Wrap an arbitrary REST provider with OAuth + retries | `api-connector-builder` *(catalog id)* |
| Chain publish → Notion row → Slack across tools | `automation-flows` *(catalog id)* |

One line: **this skill authenticates, calls, and ingests TikTok's Content Posting + Display + Business APIs into the wiki. What to post and how to package it belong to the shortform-strategy / shortform-ideation / shortform-packaging siblings; multi-network posting belongs to social-publisher.**

## 1. One-time setup (do this before any code)

A checklist, because each missing step produces a distinct, confusing failure later:

1. Register a **TikTok developer app** in the developer portal.
2. **Add the products you need**: Login Kit (OAuth), Content Posting API (publish), Display API (read counts). Insights live in the **separate TikTok for Business portal** — enable that account access too if you need watch time/completion.
3. Set an exact **redirect URI** for the OAuth flow.
4. **Submit the app for audit before posting public content.** An unaudited app can only post **privately** (`SELF_ONLY`) and only to a limited set of test users. This is the #1 "works on my machine, breaks in prod" surprise — see rule below.
5. If you publish by URL (`PULL_FROM_URL`), **verify the domain / URL-prefix** in the portal (DNS TXT or URL-prefix), or every init returns `url_ownership_unverified`.

The three gates are independent. Do not assume one approval covers everything:

```text
Bad:  "My app is approved, so publish + insights both work."
Good: Content Posting *audit* gates public publish;
      Display *scope* (video.list) gates own-video counts;
      Business *portal* access gates watch time / completion / impression sources.
      Three separate gates — check each.
```

Scope table — request only what the job needs:

| Scope | Grants | Use for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `video.publish` | Direct Post to the public feed | `/post/publish/video/init/` (audit-gated) |
| `video.upload` | Upload to drafts/inbox for the user to finish | `/post/publish/inbox/video/init/` |
| `video.list` | Read your own videos + basic counters | Display `POST /v2/video/query/` |
| `user.info.basic` | Read profile (open_id, display name, avatar) | `POST /v2/user/info/` |

Full app-registration + product-enable walkthrough, the audit gate, and `scope_not_authorized` troubleshooting live in `references/oauth-setup.md`.

## 2. Get an authed client and keep the token alive

OAuth v2: send the user to `https://www.tiktok.com/v2/auth/authorize/`, receive a `code` at your redirect URI, exchange it at `https://open.tiktokapis.com/v2/oauth/token/`, and **store the refresh token**.

The lifecycle is the load-bearing fact: **access token expires in 24 hours** (`expires_in: 86400`); **refresh token lasts 365 days** (`refresh_expires_in: 31536000`) and renews without user re-consent. So a daily-pull cron **MUST refresh the access token every run**, and a long-idle account silently dies at the 365-day refresh boundary.

```python
# python: raw REST, no official TikTok SDK. requests/httpx both fine.
import time, json, os, requests

TOKEN_URL = "https://open.tiktokapis.com/v2/oauth/token/"
STORE = "tiktok_token.json"   # gitignored — holds the rotating refresh_token

def load(): return json.load(open(STORE)) if os.path.exists(STORE) else {}
def save(t): t["obtained_at"] = int(time.time()); json.dump(t, open(STORE, "w"))

def access_token():
    t = load()
    fresh = t.get("access_token") and time.time() < t.get("obtained_at", 0) + t["expires_in"] - 60
    if fresh:
        return t["access_token"]
    r = requests.post(TOKEN_URL, data={                 # refresh every run, 24h expiry
        "client_key": os.environ["TIKTOK_CLIENT_KEY"],
        "client_secret": os.environ["TIKTOK_CLIENT_SECRET"],
        "grant_type": "refresh_token",
        "refresh_token": t["refresh_token"],            # 365-day lifetime; rotates
    }, headers={"Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"})
    r.raise_for_status()
    new = r.json()
    save(new)                                           # persist the NEW refresh_token
    return new["access_token"]
```

```javascript
// node: built-in fetch, no SDK.
import fs from "node:fs";
const STORE = "tiktok_token.json";

async function accessToken() {
  const t = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(STORE, "utf8"));
  if (t.access_token && Date.now() / 1000 < t.obtained_at + t.expires_in - 60) return t.access_token;
  const r = await fetch("https://open.tiktokapis.com/v2/oauth/token/", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" },
    body: new URLSearchParams({
      client_key: process.env.TIKTOK_CLIENT_KEY,
      client_secret: process.env.TIKTOK_CLIENT_SECRET,
      grant_type: "refresh_token",
      refresh_token: t.refresh_token,
    }),
  });
  const n = await r.json();
  n.obtained_at = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000);
  fs.writeFileSync(STORE, JSON.stringify(n));          // persist rotated refresh_token
  return n.access_token;
}
```

Rule: persist the **refresh token** and re-read it each run, never a bare `access_token`. A hardcoded `access_token=...` literal is a guaranteed failure within 24 hours — and is exactly what `verify.sh` flags.

Full token-exchange flow (authorize URL params, PKCE, code exchange) is in `references/oauth-setup.md`.

## 3. Publish a video (init → transfer → poll)

Publishing is always **three steps**: init the publish, transfer the bytes, poll until processing finishes (it is async). Pick the transfer mode first:

| Situation | Source | Endpoint |
| --- | --- | --- |
| File is local / in your control | `FILE_UPLOAD` | `/post/publish/video/init/` |
| File is at a **verified** HTTPS URL | `PULL_FROM_URL` | `/post/publish/video/init/` |
| Should land as a draft the user finalizes | `FILE_UPLOAD` | `/post/publish/inbox/video/init/` |

**Init** (FILE_UPLOAD) — returns `publish_id` and an `upload_url`:

```python
import math, requests

CHUNK = 10 * 1024 * 1024                      # 10 MB, inside the 5–64 MB window
size = os.path.getsize("clip.mp4")
chunk_count = 1 if size < 5 * 1024 * 1024 else math.ceil(size / CHUNK)

init = requests.post(
    "https://open.tiktokapis.com/v2/post/publish/video/init/",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {access_token()}",
             "Content-Type": "application/json; charset=UTF-8"},
    json={
        "post_info": {"title": "caption #fyp", "privacy_level": "SELF_ONLY"},  # public needs audit
        "source_info": {
            "source": "FILE_UPLOAD",
            "video_size": size,
            "chunk_size": CHUNK if size >= 5 * 1024 * 1024 else size,
            "total_chunk_count": chunk_count,
        },
    }).json()
publish_id = init["data"]["publish_id"]
upload_url = init["data"]["upload_url"]
```

**Transfer** — PUT chunks **sequentially** to `upload_url` with a `Content-Range` header. Chunk **min 5 MB, max 64 MB** (final chunk up to 128 MB), **1–1000 chunks**; a file under 5 MB is one chunk equal to the file size. Each PUT returns **206** (more to send) or **201** (last chunk accepted):

```python
with open("clip.mp4", "rb") as f:
    for i in range(chunk_count):
        first = i * CHUNK
        data = f.read(CHUNK)
        last = first + len(data) - 1
        r = requests.put(upload_url, data=data, headers={
            "Content-Type": "video/mp4",
            "Content-Range": f"bytes {first}-{last}/{size}",  # exact byte span
        })
        assert r.status_code in (206, 201), r.text     # 206 = continue, 201 = done
```

**Poll** — TikTok processes asynchronously; check status until `PUBLISH_COMPLETE`. Respect the cap below — do not tight-loop:

```python
import time
while True:
    s = requests.post(
        "https://open.tiktokapis.com/v2/post/publish/status/fetch/",
        headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {access_token()}",
                 "Content-Type": "application/json; charset=UTF-8"},
        json={"publish_id": publish_id}).json()
    status = s["data"]["status"]
    if status in ("PUBLISH_COMPLETE", "FAILED"):
        break
    time.sleep(10)                                      # 6/min cap — sleep, never spin
```

**Rate limit: 6 requests/minute per user access token** → `rate_limit_exceeded`. Throttle init/status calls and back off; a tight status-poll loop blows the budget in seconds.

`PULL_FROM_URL` requires the domain/URL-prefix to be verified in the portal (HTTPS only, no redirects, 1-hour download timeout) or init returns `url_ownership_unverified`. Full PULL_FROM_URL init body and verification steps are in `references/metrics-and-publish.md`.

## 4. Pull performance (two APIs, one rule)

The load-bearing distinction: **Display gives you counters; only the Business API gives you watch time, completion, and traffic.**

```python
# (a) Display API — basic counters only. scope video.list, up to 20 ids/request.
counts = requests.post(
    "https://open.tiktokapis.com/v2/video/query/",
    params={"fields": "id,title,view_count,like_count,comment_count,share_count,duration,create_time"},
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {access_token()}",
             "Content-Type": "application/json"},
    json={"filters": {"video_ids": ["<id1>", "<id2>"]}}).json()
# returns: view_count, like_count, comment_count, share_count, duration, title, create_time
```

```python
# (b) Business Account API — the real engagement signal.
# Returns the metrics Display CANNOT: average_time_watched, total_time_watched,
# full_video_watched_rate (completion), impression_sources (FYP / Following / profile /
# search), audience_countries. (Endpoint shape in references/metrics-and-publish.md.)
```

```text
Bad:  expect average_time_watched / full_video_watched_rate from /v2/video/query/
Good: counters from Display /v2/video/query/;
      watch time + completion + impression_sources from the Business Account API.
```

Caveat: **Business insight metrics lag 24–48h** and can differ from the in-app numbers. Treat a fresh pull as provisional — the wiki log (next section) is where you watch them settle. Full metric catalog split by API is in `references/metrics-and-publish.md`.

## 5. Ingest into the wiki — the actual deliverable

A pull that prints to stdout and vanishes is wasted. **Every pull appends a dated entry under `02-DOCS/wiki/shortform/`**, platform-namespaced, so the account's numbers become queryable history the strategy/packaging siblings can read.

```text
02-DOCS/wiki/shortform/
  index.md                       # rolling pointer to latest snapshot + open questions
  tiktok-account-2026-06-02.md   # dated account snapshot (one per pull)
  videos/tiktok-<video_id>.md    # per-video running log, newest entry on top
```

Filenames carry the `tiktok-` prefix because the same `shortform/` wiki may also hold Instagram and YouTube pulls — namespacing keeps platforms from colliding.

Per-pull entry template. The frontmatter is **OKF v0.1 conformant** — a non-empty `type` is the only hard requirement; `title`/`tags`/`timestamp` are the recommended OKF surface; the domain `date`/`range`/`account`/`platform`/`source` keys the siblings parse are preserved additively (OKF tolerates extra keys). `date` is the reporting day; `timestamp` is the ISO 8601 write moment:

```markdown
---
type: shortform-metrics
title: TikTok account snapshot — 2026-06-02
tags: [tiktok, metrics, snapshot]
timestamp: 2026-06-02T09:00:00Z
date: 2026-06-02
range: 2026-05-26..2026-06-01
account: <open_id>
platform: tiktok
source: display-api + business-account-api
---
## KPIs
views: 52,140 | likes: 3,902 | comments: 211 | shares: 488

## Watch
full_video_watched_rate: 28.4% | avg_time_watched: 6.1s | total_time_watched: 88h

## Impression sources (top 3)
For You 71% · Personal profile 14% · Search 7%

## What changed since last pull
completion +3.1pts after the tighter cold-open; FYP share up 5pts.
```

Rule: **append, never overwrite.** The feedback log *is* the value — overwriting yesterday's snapshot destroys the trend the siblings need, and erases the 24–48h settling you only see across pulls. The per-video log (`videos/tiktok-<id>.md`) is an OKF append-log: write its frontmatter header once, prepend each new dated block newest-first, never edit a past block. `index.md` is the OKF reserved file — no frontmatter, standard markdown links only. Exact file tree, frontmatter, naming, and how siblings read the log: `references/wiki-schema.md`.

## 6. Rate & failure math

The publish token is capped at **6 requests/minute**. Wrap publish/status calls in a token-bucket or backoff-with-jitter helper, and refresh the access token (24h expiry) before each cron run.

Error → cause map:

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `scope_not_authorized` | Scope missing or not approved for the app | Add the scope; re-consent; check app approval |
| Only `SELF_ONLY` posts work | App not audited | Submit for audit; use test users until approved |
| `url_ownership_unverified` on init | PULL_FROM_URL domain not verified | Verify domain/URL-prefix (DNS TXT) in the portal |
| `rate_limit_exceeded` | >6 req/min on the user token | Throttle + backoff; stop tight-looping the poll |
| 401 / `access_token_invalid` mid-cron | 24h access token expired | Refresh before each run; persist refresh_token |
| Empty watch time / completion | Wrong API **or** <24–48h since post | Use the Business API, not Display; wait for lag |
| Refresh fails after long idle | 365-day refresh token expired | Re-run the OAuth consent flow |

## Anti-patterns

| Anti-pattern | Why it bites | Do instead |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Commit `client_secret` / a token file holding `refresh_token` | Leaks full account control to anyone with repo read | Gitignore it; load from env/secret store |
| Hardcode a 24h `access_token` literal | Dead within a day; breaks every cron | Persist the refresh token; refresh each run |
| Tight-loop the status poll | Blows the 6/min cap → `rate_limit_exceeded` | Sleep ~10s between polls; back off on 429 |
| Expect watch time from Display `video/query` | That field does not exist there | Counts from Display, watch time from Business |
| Treat an unaudited app as production | Only `SELF_ONLY` posts work for real users | Submit for audit before public posting |
| `PULL_FROM_URL` without domain verification | Every init returns `url_ownership_unverified` | Verify domain/URL-prefix first, HTTPS, no redirects |
| Assume one approval covers publish + insights | Three independent gates | Posting audit + Display scope + Business portal |
| Overwrite yesterday's wiki snapshot | Destroys the trend + the 24–48h settling | Append a new dated entry every pull |
