Usage: claude self-hosted-runner [options]

Connection:
  --api-url <url>             API base URL (default: ${DEFAULT_SELF_HOSTED_RUNNER_API_URL})
  --environment-secret-file <path>
                              Path to environment secret file (or set SELF_HOSTED_RUNNER_ENVIRONMENT_SECRET)
                              (--pool-secret-file / SELF_HOSTED_RUNNER_POOL_SECRET are deprecated aliases.)
  --lock-to-account <id>      Lock runner to a single account at registration (webhook-driven on-demand
                              spawn). Only that account's sessions are assigned.
                              [env: SELF_HOSTED_RUNNER_LOCK_TO_ACCOUNT]
  --client-label <label>      Observability label sent at registration (default: hostname). Shown
                              beside the runner in the Anthropic console; never used for
                              authorization or routing. Set it when the hostname is not
                              meaningful, e.g. to a VM or container name.
                              [env: SELF_HOSTED_RUNNER_CLIENT_LABEL]
  --proxy-authorization-command <shell command>
                              For egress proxies that require a Proxy-Authorization header (for
                              example a short-lived bearer token) on every CONNECT. The command's
                              stdout is the full header value (e.g. "Bearer <token>"); it is run
                              afresh for each new connection to the proxy, so rotating tokens stay
                              current. Requires HTTPS_PROXY (or HTTP_PROXY) to name that upstream
                              proxy; ALL_PROXY alone is not consulted. When set, the runner starts a
                              small forward proxy on 127.0.0.1 that adds the header, and points
                              itself and every session it runs at it (HTTPS_PROXY/HTTP_PROXY are
                              rewritten for child processes, other proxy variables incl. ALL_PROXY
                              are cleared for them; NO_PROXY is unchanged). The value is never
                              logged. Not supported with the orchestrator subcommand yet.
                              [env: ${PROXY_AUTHORIZATION_COMMAND_ENV_VAR}]
  --proxy-authorization-file <path>
                              Same, but the header value is read from a file (re-read for each new
                              connection, so a file rotated in place is picked up). Set only one of
                              the two. [env: ${PROXY_AUTHORIZATION_FILE_ENV_VAR}]

Runtime:
  --capacity <n>              Max concurrent sessions (default: ${DEFAULT_RUNNER_CAPACITY})
  --base-dir <path>           Base directory for repo checkouts (default: ${DEFAULT_RUNNER_BASE_DIR};
                              required on Windows, which has no default)
                              [env: SELF_HOSTED_RUNNER_BASE_DIR]
  --exec-path <path>          Binary to spawn for child sessions. Default: this process's own binary.
                              [env: SELF_HOSTED_RUNNER_EXEC_PATH]
  --hooks-dir <path>          Directory of lifecycle hook scripts (checkout, command, post-session).
                              Absent hooks fall through to built-in behavior.
                              [env: SELF_HOSTED_RUNNER_HOOKS_DIR]
  --session-stop-grace-sec <n>
                              How long to wait for the Claude process to exit cleanly after a
                              session ends, before force-killing it. The post-session hook runs
                              after this. Default: ${SESSION_STOP_GRACE_MS/1000}.
                              [env: SELF_HOSTED_RUNNER_SESSION_STOP_GRACE_MS, in ms]
  --post-session-hook-timeout-sec <n>
                              SIGTERM budget for the post-session lifecycle hook, on every session
                              end including runner shutdown. Default: ${POST_SESSION_HOOK_TIMEOUT_MS/1000}.
                              [env: SELF_HOSTED_RUNNER_POST_SESSION_HOOK_TIMEOUT_MS, in ms]
  --drain-wait-sec <n>        On SIGTERM/SIGINT, wait up to N seconds for each session's in-flight
                              turn (a foreground tool call) and running background tasks to finish
                              before sending the session process its SIGTERM. Adds N to the
                              advertised shutdown budget.
                              A background task that has JUST finished also counts as
                              in-flight until the follow-up turn that reads its result starts
                              (bounded by SELF_HOSTED_RUNNER_BG_RESULT_GRACE_MS, in ms;
                              default: ${BACKGROUND_RESULT_GRACE_MS/1000}s; 0 or an unusable value falls back
                              to the default — the hold cannot be disabled).
                              Default: 0 (send SIGTERM immediately). Max: 86400.

                              (--drain-wait-bg-tasks-sec is a deprecated alias for this flag.)
  --git-ssh-rewrite <host>    Rewrite https://<host>/... source URLs to git@<host>:... (repeatable).
                              For SSH-only git hosts.
  --git-host-rewrite <f>=<t>  Rewrite https://<f>/... source URLs to https://<t>/... (repeatable).
                              For split-horizon DNS where the runner reaches GHE via a different
                              hostname than the control plane. Applied before --git-ssh-rewrite.
  --use-anthropic-git-proxy   Opt this runner into Anthropic-managed git (clones are authenticated
                              server-side with the session creator's stored GitHub OAuth token, or
                              the org's GitHub App installation token for bot/agent sessions; you
                              don't manage git auth on the runner). Supersedes --git-host-rewrite
                              and --git-ssh-rewrite.

                              if set, and the whole $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git directory (default
                              ~/.config/git; config, ignore, attributes and anything else in it),
                              at startup and before every session, with no backup, so one session's
                              git settings cannot reach the next.
                              The replacement holds only this runner's git credential settings for
                              the Anthropic API host (plus the --configure-git settings, if set) and
                              is left in place when the runner exits. Run this flag only under a
                              dedicated runner account or container, never a personal login; keep
                              operator git config in /etc/gitconfig or use --configure-git.

  --push-outcome-on-release   On a runner-initiated non-completed session end (SIGTERM drain,
                              idle-release, failed), push every tracked outcome branch to origin
                              before deleting it, so in-flight commits survive a runner restart.
                              Skipped on server-initiated deassign. On a resumed session (worker
                              epoch > 1), the prep path fetches any previously pushed outcome
                              branch from origin and continues from it, so histories stay
                              linear. CAVEAT: the resume-fetch trusts refs/heads/<outcome-branch>
                              on the source remote — anyone with push access to that ref can
                              place content into the resumed workspace; if your source revision
                              is protected but claude/* refs are not, that collaborator write
                              surface widens on resume. Repos checked out via the checkout
                              lifecycle hook are NOT pushed — use the post-session hook to
                              snapshot those. Adds 30s
                              (total, shared across all pushes) to the advertised
                              shutdown budget.

                              locked account's queue for that many seconds before exiting.

  --retire-at <epoch-seconds> Retire the runner at the given wall-clock time (absolute Unix timestamp, in
                              seconds): release every active session through the ReleaseSession path that
                              --release-idle-session-min uses (the session parks server-side and a fresh
                              runner picks it up on the user's next message), stop taking new work, and
                              exit 0 once the slots are empty. A session still mid-turn at that time is
                              released as soon as its turn ends; background work a finished turn left
                              running gets up to 60s of grace, then the session parks anyway (perpetual
                              monitor tasks don't hold it at all). Use this when the host hard-kills the
                              runner at a known time (e.g. a sandbox lifetime cap): set it far enough
                              before the kill to cover typical turns PLUS the per-session shutdown

                              so sessions park cleanly and the post-session hook isn't truncated by
                              the kill. Default: never. [env: SELF_HOSTED_RUNNER_RETIRE_AT, in seconds]
  --defer-shutdown-max-min <m>
                              On the FIRST SIGTERM/SIGINT, do not drain: stop taking new work (the runner
                              advertises zero capacity and keeps polling only as its lease heartbeat) and
                              otherwise keep running as it does today, then finish shutting down M minutes
                              later. Until then attached sessions are served normally and leave only the way
                              they would without any signal: --release-idle-session-min, if set, releases a
                              session whose user has gone idle (it parks server-side and a fresh runner
                              resumes it on the user's next message); a session that flag would not release
                              — it is unset, or the finished turn still has background work running — simply
                              stays attached. M minutes after the first signal every session still attached
                              is released through that same park path at once regardless of idle time (one
                              mid-turn as soon as its turn ends; background work a finished turn left running
                              gets up to 60s), and anything STILL attached ${(DEFERRED_SESSION_RELEASE_GRACE_MS+SHUTDOWN_MARGIN_MS)/1000}s later (that 60s + a 15s
                              margin; --drain-wait-sec + 15s if longer) is drained as on a second signal —
                              the one path that requeues instead of parking. The runner exits 0 as soon as
                              it holds no session, before or after M. A SECOND signal drains immediately, as
                              the first does without this flag; a third force-exits (so does a signal during
                              that last-resort drain). READ THIS BEFORE ENABLING: your supervisor sends one
                              SIGTERM and then SIGKILLs at its stop timeout; if that timeout ends first,
                              every still-attached session is killed WITHOUT its post-session hook or
                              deregister and is requeued to another runner about a minute later — strictly
                              worse than the default drain. So set the stop timeout
                              (terminationGracePeriodSeconds etc.) to at least M minutes + ${(DEFERRED_SESSION_RELEASE_GRACE_MS+SHUTDOWN_MARGIN_MS)/1000}s (that post-ceiling
                              grace; --drain-wait-sec + 15s if longer) + the shutdown budget above — the runner
                              prints this sum at startup when the flag is set. --startup-timeout-min and
                              --kill-session-after-min keep working unchanged during the wait. Fractional
                              minutes are accepted. Default: 0 (off — drain on the first signal).

Per-session watchdogs:
  --release-idle-session-min <n>  Release a session slot after N min of no user input (turn finished,
                                  or parked at a permission prompt, user idle). Runner exits if this

  --startup-timeout-min <n>       Release a session slot if the child has not completed initialization
                                  N min after spawn — covers a child hung during --resume hydration or
                                  MCP connect, and a session assigned with no pending input. Cleared
                                  once the child emits system:init, after which --release-idle-session-min
                                  takes over. Default: 15. 0 disables. Max: ${MAX_TIMEOUT_MINUTES}.

                                  At the deadline a session that is waiting on its user (idle, parked
                                  at a permission prompt, or still starting up) is RELEASED — paused
                                  server-side, resumable — not killed; a turn in flight is released
                                  when it next parks or finishes; a turn still running (or a release
                                  the server keeps declining) is SIGTERMed at the hard cap, 15 min past
                                  the deadline (override: SELF_HOSTED_RUNNER_MAX_LIFETIME_GRACE_MS, in
