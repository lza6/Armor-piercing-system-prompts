Identifier for the dialog the host should render. Open string union — new kinds may be added without bumping the protocol. A kind is only sent in sessions where some attached client declared it in initialize.supportedDialogKinds (declare exactly the kinds you can render); on multi-client transports the request still reaches every attached client. A host that receives a kind it did not declare must not answer it (an error-subtype response is discarded and the dialog stays pending) — never with {behavior: "cancelled"}, which is a real settlement treated as the user dismissing the dialog. An unanswered dialog is cancelled by the CLI after its dialog deadline.
