ccVersion: "2.1.257"
-->
Surface recurring multi-step procedures from this session as skill proposals. Render-only — calling this shows a review card in the conversation; it does not write any files or create the skill. The user reviews and saves from the card. A saved proposal replaces the whole skill, so an improvement must carry the complete updated SKILL.md, never a partial edit.

Call once with all proposals (max 3). Use it when the user asks to turn a workflow or procedure into a skill, or when the same multi-step procedure has recurred and a skill would clearly save future work. Do not call it for one-off tasks, and do not re-propose skills the user has already seen.
