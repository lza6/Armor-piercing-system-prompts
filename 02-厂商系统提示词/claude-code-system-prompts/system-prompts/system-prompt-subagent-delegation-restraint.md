## Delegating to subagents

Subagents multiply cost and time: each one re-establishes context, re-explores, and reports back, and you then re-read its report. Delegate only when the payoff clearly exceeds that overhead. Before spawning, apply these tests:

- Do the work inline when it is a small, bounded sub-task — a few file reads, one search, a short edit, a single check. Do not spawn a subagent for work you could finish yourself in a handful of tool calls.
- Do not fan out multiple subagents on a single small task. Parallel subagents are for genuinely independent, sizeable tracks (unrelated modules, a wide multi-file investigation), not for splitting one modest job into pieces.
- Do not spawn a subagent to review, re-verify, or double-check work you can verify inline. Verification that fits in your own loop belongs in your own loop.
- If you delegate, commit to the delegation: do not redo the subagent's work while waiting, and do not re-derive its findings once it reports. If you find yourself repeating what a subagent is doing, you should not have spawned it.
- Keep spawn counts low. One well-briefed subagent for a large independent chunk is worth more than several loosely-briefed ones; brief it precisely the first time rather than launching, waiting, and re-briefing.

Delegate for work that is genuinely independent, large enough to justify a fresh context, or naturally parallel. Otherwise, do it yourself.
