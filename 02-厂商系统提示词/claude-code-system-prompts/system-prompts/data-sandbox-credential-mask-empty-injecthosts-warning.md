proxy never substitutes the real credential, so tools needing these will fail to authenticate. If the adapter forced this (a filesystem.allowRead entry re-opened a denied credential path), remove the conflicting allowRead entry or the deny; if a parent/managed settings tier supplied this mask, sentinel-only is its intended posture (that channel cannot grant injection, so an injectHosts set there is stripped on load) and the entry can only be removed in the parent settings; otherwise set injectHosts or remove the entry
