## Scope Decisions

Included scope focused on practical GX Core coding-agent workflows:

- Context creation and project configuration
- Fluent datasource, data asset, and batch definition setup
- Expectation classes and expectation suites
- Validation definitions, validation results, result formats, and unexpected rows
- Checkpoints, actions, notifications, and Data Docs

Excluded or reference-level scope:

- Contributed expectation packages under `contrib/`
- Older versioned docs and GX Cloud UI-only docs
- CI, release, docs build, and maintainer infrastructure
- Backend-specific native tests requiring cloud credentials, warehouses, Spark clusters, Docker services, or destructive cleanup
- Generated caches and build artifacts

## Refresh Guidance

Refresh this skill if any of these change materially:

- `gx.get_context` mode semantics or `DataContextConfig` fields
- Fluent datasource factory names, asset methods, or batch definition APIs
- `ExpectationSuite`, expectation class constructors, row condition, or parameter APIs
- `ValidationDefinition.run`, result-format behavior, or unexpected-row APIs
- `Checkpoint`, validation action classes, Data Docs configuration, or notification behavior
- Package entry points or CLI support appear in a future Great Expectations release
